    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOUR BUSINESS\nOur mission is to grow and empower local economies. We aim to achieve this by providing a logistics and technology platform that enables local businesses to address consumers\u2019 modern expectations of ease and immediacy.\nOur business consists of our Marketplace and Platform Services. We built our Marketplace to serve the needs of three key constituents: merchants, consumers and Dashers. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand through delivery, generally facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by consumers. As part of our Marketplace, we offer merchants a broad array of services that enable them to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition and demand generation, order fulfillment, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We also enable merchants to advertise and promote on our platform in order to acquire new consumers and drive incremental sales.\nOur Marketplace provides a platform for over 25 million monthly active users (\"MAU\")1 to discover, engage with, and purchase goods from merchants in their community. Our aim is to consistently improve our consumer value proposition by increasing the quantity and variety of merchants that are available on our Marketplace, while also improving the level of convenience, quality, and service we provide. Marketplace also includes DashPass, our membership program which aims to improve affordability and lower transactional friction by reducing the delivery and service fees we charge consumers.\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our revenue today, our Platform Services business, which primarily consists of Drive and Storefront, offers services to help merchants facilitate sales through their own channels. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants to fulfill consumer demand they have generated through their own channels using our local logistics platform. Storefront enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nFor Dashers, both our Marketplace and Platform Services provide opportunities for those looking for accessible and flexible ways to earn and achieve their goals. Dashers choose when and where to dash, as well as how frequently and for how long to dash each time they choose to do so. We provide earnings transparency so that Dashers can make informed decisions about the deliveries they choose to make.\nWe believe our business benefits only when we provide attractive services for each of our three key constituents: merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Consequently, in order to grow our business, we intend to provide merchants with a growing suite of services that help them build and grow their businesses; consumers with a broad selection of merchants to choose from, consistent and high quality experiences, and affordability that drives increased adoption; and Dashers with an attractive combination of accessibility, choice, and earning opportunity that competes effectively for their time.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences, fragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the following criteria:\n\u2022Merchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our business enablement and demand fulfillment services. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the scale of our consumer base, the breadth of our demand fulfillment capabilities, and our broad array of services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges.\n\u2022Consumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors, including the selection of merchants available, the quality of the ordering, fulfillment and service experience, and affordability. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the combination of merchant selection, experience, and value we provide.\n\u2022Dashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors, including accessibility of our platform, flexibility in when, where, how much and how frequently to work, and earnings potential. We believe that we are well-positioned based on the limited requirements necessary to qualify, the density of our network, the improving efficiency of our platform, and the opportunities we provide Dashers to earn.\n1 Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplace in the past month, measured as of December 31, 2021.\nLocal food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. In the United States, we compete with other local food delivery logistics platforms including Uber Eats, Grubhub (acquired by Just Eat Takeaway in June 2021), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino\u2019s, online ordering systems, other merchants which own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocery delivery services, traditional grocers, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. With Drive, and as we continue to expand into other industry verticals beyond food, we expect to compete with large Internet companies with substantial resources, users, and brand power, such as Amazon and Google.\nWe believe we compete favorably for merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our innovation, brand, and focused execution have allowed us to quickly extend our network and geographic reach and we plan to continue our efforts to expand within our existing markets and enter new markets and geographies in the future. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Operations-We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\u201d\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had over 8,600 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values that we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash, we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the future-for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid innovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\nDashers\nWe are committed to make dashing an earnings opportunity that is accessible, flexible, and supportive of social progress. In 2021, over 6 million people dashed2, earning a total of over $11 billion. Dashers worked an average of less than four active hours per week throughout the year.\nWe believe choice and access are empowering. Our goal with dashing is to provide as many people as we can with an opportunity to earn incremental income in a way that fits their lives. Since Dashers are independent contractors, we must compete for their time and effort with every order. We compete against other earning opportunities as well as alternative uses of time like leisure. Because of this competition, we must provide earnings opportunities that are attractive, worthwhile, and incremental to other choices available. Specifically, we strive to make dashing positive based on:\n\u2022Accessibility: We believe the barriers-to-entry in dashing are very low. Prospective Dashers must pass a background check and, in most geographies, have access to a bike, scooter, or car. People who qualify to become Dashers are often eligible to begin generating income within a day of signing up. We know of no other earning opportunity that provides superior accessibility to dashing.\n\u2022Flexibility: Once Dashers qualify, they choose whether to dash, where to dash, when to dash, how long to dash for, and how frequently to dash. This allows Dashers to scale their effort to their earning needs. It also allows Dashers to generate earnings around the other commitments they have in their lives, which often include full or part-time jobs, school, parenting or commitments to care for family or friends.\n2 Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in the past year, measured as of December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Earnings: Dashers dash in order to earn income, so we must provide earnings that are competitive with alternative opportunities and commensurate with Dashers' expectations. In addition to the absolute level of earnings, we provide tools that improve immediacy and accessibility of earnings, as this is often valued by Dashers.\n\u2022Service: We aim to provide Dashers with high levels of service. This includes a dedicated service team that is accessible through our app, website, email, chat, and phone. We also provide visibility into our policies and practices for determining ratings and deactivations.\nOur mission to grow and empower local economies creates a culture that promotes progress in all of our stakeholder relationships. Just as importantly, our business cannot thrive, or even survive, without Dashers. As a result, our business and financial ambitions are well aligned with our goal to make dashing an attractive and incremental earning opportunity that promotes social progress by giving people more choice in how they achieve their financial goals.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the cities we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and retain the talent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we amplify the voices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has \u201croom at the table\u201d and the tools, resources, and opportunities to succeed.\nSome of our diversity and inclusion programs at DoorDash include:\nElevate\nElevate is a program designed to increase the representation of women of color in leadership roles at our company. The year-long program starts with each member of our management team sponsoring fellows to serve on our leadership team, which exposes them to senior leadership and supports their development of business skills.\nWomen\u2019s Leadership Forum\nOur Women\u2019s Leadership Forum equips mid- to senior-level technical women with skills to thrive in our workplace. This six-month program happens once a year and includes classroom-style learning, one-on-one coaching, and group roundtables. Members of our management team actively participate in the forum.\nEmployee Resource Groups\nWe support employee-led employee resource groups (\"ERGs\"), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We currently have eight ERGs: Black@DoorDash, Latinx@DoorDash, Women@DoorDash, Pride@DoorDash (LGBTQIA+), AAPI@DoorDash (Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders), Veterans@DoorDash, Indigenous@DoorDash, and Parents@DoorDash, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2021, we had 250 issued U.S. patents, 53 U.S. patent applications pending, and 25 patent applications pending in a foreign jurisdiction. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2021, we held 37 registered trademarks in the United States and 73 registered\ntrademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous pending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property-Intellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property-Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\u201d\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, commissions and fees, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, membership services, intellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data protection, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. The sale and delivery of goods through our platform is also subject to laws, regulations, and standards that govern food safety, alcohol, tobacco, cannabidiol, pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, hazardous substances, and the interstate and intrastate transport of goods. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies.\nSee the sections titled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d including the sections titled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment-If Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected,\u201d \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment-Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims,\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties-We primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third party and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected,\u201d for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nWe were incorporated in 2013 as Palo Alto Delivery Inc., a Delaware corporation.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\n\u2022We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\n\u2022We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future;\n\u2022We may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\n\u2022If Dashers in the United States are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, or if we fail to comply with Proposition 22 in the State of California, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected;\n\u2022We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected;\n\u2022If we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-effective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\n\u2022If we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\n\u2022We rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and failure by them to maintain their service levels or any changes to their operating costs could adversely affect our business;\n\u2022We are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability, expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business;\n\u2022Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those related to worker classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and the costs of complying with such laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;\n\u2022We expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\n\u2022Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic wane;\n\u2022The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment;\n\u2022The multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting Agreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (the \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\n\u2022The proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\") will not be completed unless the conditions are satisfied or waived. If the Transaction is not completed, our and Wolt\u2019s future business and financial results could be negatively affected;\n\u2022The Transaction and the integration of Wolt may subject us to certain liabilities associated with Wolt or liabilities that may arise in connection with the completion of the Transaction; and\n\u2022Our and Wolt\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Transaction, which could have an adverse effect on our and Wolt's results of operations, cash flows, and financial position;\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed our pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability to:\n\u2022accurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\n\u2022increase the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\n\u2022successfully compete with current and future competitors;\n\u2022successfully expand our business in existing markets and enter new markets and geographies;\n\u2022anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022maintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\n\u2022adapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\n\u2022avoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\n\u2022develop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased usage, as well as the deployment of new features and services;\n\u2022hire, integrate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\n\u2022effectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\n\u2022effectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future.\nAlthough we generated net income of $23 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, we have incurred net losses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve profitability again, or maintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net loss of $667 million, $461 million, and $468 million in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2020, and 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. We expect our costs will increase\nover time and our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our business and operating as a public company. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform features and services, expanding into new markets and geographies, and increasing our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and other outstanding equity awards will result in increases in our expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2021, we have $1.9 billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards. Additionally, we may expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance obligations that arise upon the initial settlement of certain of our RSUs.\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve, maintain or increase profitability.\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our recent revenue growth rate, growth in demand for our offerings, and financial performance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our revenue was $885 million, $2.9 billion, and $4.9 billion, respectively, representing a 226% and 69% year-over-year growth rate, respectively. In addition, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. The circumstances that accelerated the growth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue, and we expect growth in consumer demand and our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline in future periods compared to growth rates in 2020 and 2021. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous quarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business metrics growth in future periods. In particular, our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods. We expect our revenue growth rate to continue to fluctuate over the short term and decline in the long term. Our revenue growth rate may decline in future periods compared to growth rates in 2020 and 2021 as the size of our business grows and as we achieve higher market adoption rates. We may also experience declines in our revenue growth rate as a result of a number of factors, including slowing demand for our platform, insufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities, increasing regulatory costs, and the maturation of our business, among others. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our business, which may not result in increased revenue or growth. In addition, we have strategically focused on suburban markets and smaller metropolitan areas since our founding because of the opportunity that these markets have presented for our local logistics platform. If the demand for local logistics platforms does not continue to grow in these markets, or if we are unable to maintain our category share in these markets, our revenue growth rate could be adversely affected. If our revenue growth rate declines, investors\u2019 perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences, fragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. In the United States, we compete with other local food delivery logistics companies, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub (acquired by Just Eat Takeaway in June 2021), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino\u2019s, online ordering systems, other merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may compete with large Internet companies with substantial resources, users, and brand power, such as Amazon and Google. Further, as we continue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. Changing traditional ordering habits is difficult,\nand if merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to local food delivery logistics as we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established relationships with local merchants and larger existing user bases in certain markets, more successful marketing capabilities, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. Greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less attractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of merchant options or lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less appealing to consumers. Our competitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic relationships among themselves or with others, including merchants. For example, Uber acquired Postmates in December 2020, and Just Eat Takeaway, a European local logistics platform, acquired Grubhub in June 2021, and Lyft announced a partnership with Grubhub that allows Lyft\u2019s loyalty-program members free delivery from Grubhub restaurants. In addition, certain of our competitors have acquired kitchens to enable them to produce and deliver food directly to consumers. Our competitors could also introduce new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns than ours.\nAdditionally, many of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and consumer fees, incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services and consumer discounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, which may be more attractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our commission rates and fees or maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions in order to remain competitive, particularly in markets where we do not have a leading position. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Further, the markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These investments, along with the other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to lower their prices and fees, or increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more effectively against us. Delivery logistics services for food and the other verticals in which we compete are nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve, maintain or increase profitability. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost effective to develop their own platforms to offer online pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIn addition, within our industry, the cost to switch between offerings is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost provider and could use more than one local logistics platform, independent contractors who provide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and merchants could prefer to use the local logistics platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more than one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as existing offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more highly than ours, which would render our platform less attractive and reduce our ability to differentiate our platform. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce our commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-effective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow our platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in new markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers attracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or than it has grown in the past. In particular, our national brand partnerships are a key component of our strategy to provide a wide selection for consumers. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and our national brand partners, or\nconsumers, the value of our network would be diminished. In addition, we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to acquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may invest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for several years or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with restaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have fewer merchants. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants, or if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until terminated by partner merchants or us. Based on the type of partner agreement, partner merchants may terminate their agreements with us by providing us at least seven (7) or thirty (30) days advance notice and such agreements do not generally provide for any exclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with us, the merchant selection available on our local logistics platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our business and to our relationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain other constituencies. For example, the increased growth of our membership product, DashPass, and how compelling this offering is to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to DashPass. Additionally, many of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as discounts and other reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such consumers, thereby encouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of DashPass, through prompts and notifications and time-limited trials of DashPass and other offerings. However, these consumers may never convert to a paid membership to DashPass or access our platform after they take advantage of our promotions. If we are not able to continue to expand our consumer base or fail to convert our consumers to regular paying consumers, demand for our full-price or paid services, such as DashPass, and our revenue may grow slower than expected or decline.\nFurther, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites and applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and applications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If consumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than through our website and consumer mobile application directly, our ability to establish relationships and build brand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized experience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract and retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. To attract and retain Dashers, we have, among other things, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, such as credits to be used for orders on our platform, free DoorDash-branded apparel, and access to Dasher Experience Centers where Dashers can receive assistance with pressing issues, meet other Dashers, and participate in special events. If we do not continue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income, and other incentive programs that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors, we may fail to attract new Dashers or retain existing Dashers or increase their use of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example, if merchants and consumers choose to use competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing Dashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers or could have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and employment laws, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers, which may result in increased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of our control, such as increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles, or insurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize our platform or the use of our platform by Dashers. Our agreements with Dashers generally remain in effect until terminated by Dashers or us. Dashers may terminate their agreements with us by providing us at least seven (7) days advance notice and such agreements do not provide for any exclusivity. If we fail to attract Dashers or retain existing Dashers on\nfavorable terms, if we fail to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, or if Dashers terminate their agreements with us, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain their service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, either as a result of increased operating costs, or to offset the commission we charge, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform, including small and local independent businesses, to provide quality goods to our consumers at expected price points. If these merchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand, producing quality goods at affordable prices, or meeting our other requirements or standards, or experience problems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, our reputation and brand could be damaged. Further, an increase in merchant operating costs could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission rates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our operational costs and efficiency, and if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform. Many of the factors affecting merchant operating costs, including off-premise costs and prices, are beyond the control of merchants and include inflation, costs associated with the goods provided, labor and employee benefit costs, rent costs, and energy costs. If merchants pass along these increased operating costs and increase prices on our platform, order volume may decline. Additionally, some items on our platform are listed at higher prices relative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and could result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this \u201c Risk Factors \u201d section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022our ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\n\u2022the effects of increased competition on our business;\n\u2022our ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\n\u2022changes in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\n\u2022increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\n\u2022our business mix between Marketplace and Drive;\n\u2022the proportion of consumers that are members of DashPass;\n\u2022the impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand delivery;\n\u2022the seasonality of our business, particularly with respect to local food delivery logistics, including the effect of academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\n\u2022the impact of weather on our business;\n\u2022our ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\n\u2022our ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\n\u2022the effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\n\u2022our ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\n\u2022the success of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022the effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\n\u2022our ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\n\u2022costs associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related judgments or settlements;\n\u2022changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to merchants;\n\u2022interruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\n\u2022the attraction and engagement of qualified employees and key personnel;\n\u2022our ability to choose and effectively manage third-party service providers;\n\u2022the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events;\n\u2022the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior and our order volumes, as well as the impact of changes in the response of governments and private industry to COVID-19;\n\u2022the impact that price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms imposed by various jurisdictions, and any associated increase in the fees we charge to consumers, have on our operating results;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022the impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\n\u2022changes in the online payment transfer rate; and\n\u2022changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times. Our systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or other performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These system failures generally occur either as a result of software updates being deployed with unexpected errors or as a result of temporary infrastructure failures related to storage, network, or compute capacity being exhausted. These events have resulted in losses in revenue, though such losses have not been material to date. System failures in the future could result in significant losses of revenue. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided credits to consumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar event, including for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may voluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, the affected user could seek monetary recourse from us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful,\nwould likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or other functionality of our platform could adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic wane.\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has globally resulted in loss of life, business closures, restrictions on travel, and widespread cancellation of social gatherings. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Factors that may impact our business include:\n\u2022new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease;\n\u2022the duration and spread of the outbreak;\n\u2022the severity of travel restrictions imposed by geographic areas in which we operate, mandatory or voluntary business closures;\n\u2022regulatory actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may impact merchant operations, consumer and merchant pricing, Dasher pay, and our product offerings;\n\u2022other business disruptions that affect our workforce;\n\u2022the availability of effective vaccines and the speed at which they can be administered to the public;\n\u2022the continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19;\n\u2022the impact on capital and financial markets;\n\u2022actions taken throughout the world, including in markets in which we operate, to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact, and;\n\u2022potential changes to consumer behavior or spending patterns as markets recover.\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have allowed many of our employees to work remotely, which may impact productivity and otherwise disrupt our business operations. In addition, the current outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread global health crisis and adversely affected global economies and financial markets, and similar public health threats could do so in the future. Such events have impacted, and could in the future impact, demand for merchants and consumer purchase patterns, which in turn, could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV due to increased consumer demand for delivery, more merchants using our platform to facilitate both delivery and take-out, and improved efficiency of our local logistics platform. The circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue, and we expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline in future periods compared to growth rates in 2020 and 2021.\nFurthermore, if a virus or other disease is transmitted by human contact, as is the case with COVID-19, our employees and any constituent of our network may become infected, or may choose, or be advised, to avoid any contact with others, any of which may adversely affect our ability to provide our platform and for merchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. In addition, shelter-in-place orders and similar regulations impact merchants\u2019 ability to operate their businesses, consumers\u2019 ability to pick up orders, and Dashers\u2019 ability to make deliveries during certain times, or at all. Viruses or other diseases transmitted by human contact may in the future cause a temporary closure of merchants\u2019 businesses, either due to government mandate or voluntary preventative measures, and many of our merchants may not be able to withstand prolonged interruptions to their businesses, and may be forced to go out of business. Even if merchants are able to continue to operate their businesses, many may operate with limited hours, menus, and capacity and other limitations. Any limitations on or disruptions or closures of merchants\u2019 businesses could impact the selection available on our platform, disrupt our ability to operate our local logistics platform, and adversely affect our business.\nEven if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly and such measures are not implemented, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business. Merchants may be perceived as unsafe during such public health threats, even for order delivery or pickup. If the services offered through our platform or at other businesses in our industry become a significant risk for transmitting COVID-19 or similar public health threats, or if there is a public perception that such risk exists, demand for the use of our platform would be adversely affected. Any negative impact on consumers\u2019 willingness or ability to order delivery or complete a Pickup order, or on Dashers\u2019 willingness or ability to make deliveries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public health threat has an impact on our business, it is likely to also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201c Risk Factors\u201d section.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms will have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the amount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the fees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors\u2019 pricing and marketing strategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, over fifty (50) jurisdictions across the United States, including many jurisdictions in California, have implemented temporary price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, there are legislative proposals to make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals to be made. In addition, some jurisdictions have enacted permanent price controls, including San Francisco, California, New York, New York, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Minneapolis, Minnesota (although the latter two jurisdictions\u2019 price restrictions do not apply when certain conditions are met). We filed litigation challenging the San Francisco and New York price controls as unconstitutional and in excess of each respective jurisdiction\u2019s police power. There are legislative proposals in additional jurisdictions to make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals to be made in the future. These price controls have had in the past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These price controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers, though we are aware of a few jurisdictions that have adopted limits or explicit prohibitions against doing so in connection with price controls. An increase in the fees we charge to consumers could result in reduced demand for our services by consumers. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we categorize or collect such increased consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as confusing and/or misleading to consumers. Although temporary price controls in some jurisdictions in which we operate have expired, with the continued duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect existing price controls to persist in the near term and for additional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If any of these events occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which creates additional challenges to managing our business. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain new merchants, consumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There can be no assurance that we will not be forced, through competition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of delivery for consumers, increase the incentives we pay to Dashers that utilize our platform, or further reduce the fees and commissions we charge merchants, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive pressures. We have launched, and may in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as membership products like DashPass, and Dasher or consumer loyalty programs, or modify existing pricing methodologies or the way in which fees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our platform, any of which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers or which may result in lower commissions or fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, on April 27, 2021, we changed our merchant pricing models to better support certain U.S. restaurant partners, including by offering them a choice of three different delivery commission rates tied to varying levels of marketing support and services. Further, our consumers\u2019 price sensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these locations. In particular, our continued international expansion may require us to change our pricing strategies and to adjust to different cultural norms, including with respect to consumer pricing and gratuities. While we do and will attempt to set prices based on our prior operating experience and merchant, consumer, and Dasher feedback and engagement levels, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we could be underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, if the services on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay model for Dashers.\nOur pay model for Dashers, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led, and may continue to lead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under our former Dasher pay model, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little or no tip. Although this \u201cboost\u201d pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile, it also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being received by Dashers.\nGovernment authorities have also brought claims against us related to our former Dasher pay model and may bring similar claims in the future. For example, on November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed an action in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia alleging violations of the District of Columbia\u2019s Consumer Protection Procedures Act with respect to our former Dasher pay model and on November 30, 2020, the court entered a consent order and judgment to resolve the litigation. We could face similar claims related to our former Dasher pay model from other government authorities in the future.\nThe incorrect understanding or perception of our former Dasher pay model by some led, and may continue to lead, to some consumers providing lower tips, or no tips at all, to Dashers, which could impact the amount that Dashers are able to earn on our platform and our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We have also launched, and may in the future launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that utilize our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers. For example, in September 2019, we changed our Dasher pay model to include (i) a base pay amount for each order, which depends on the estimated time, distance, and desirability of the order, (ii) promotions for orders that meet certain conditions, including bonuses for Dashers who meet specific goals, and (iii) tips from consumers, which Dashers receive 100% of on top of base pay and promotions.\nWe increased the amount we pay to Dashers per order when we changed to our current pay model, but our current Dasher pay model may also cause less consistency in earnings across deliveries in some cases. Further, this pay model may lead to negative publicity related to perceptions of the complexity of the pay model, inconsistency in earnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, and as a result, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. In the future, based on a variety of factors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may change our pay model again. Our current pay model, and any future changes to our pay model or our ability to cost-effectively acquire and retain Dashers, could result in an increase to the fees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain consumers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors, there is a risk that Dashers may be reclassified as employees under federal or state law. As discussed further below, we have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West, Inc.v. Superior Court (\u201cDynamex\u201d), including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in June 2020. In addition, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to determine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for a 2020 ballot initiative (\u201cProposition 22\u201d) to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for Dashers, which was approved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court in California issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 have filed notices of appeal to the California Court of Appeal. Proposition 22 remains in effect pending further court proceedings. Under Proposition 22, certain provisions regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are now applicable to us and Dashers in California and our costs related to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, we do in certain circumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, several jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes in certain jurisdictions, that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in ongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work that Dashers perform. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives or other legislative processes in certain jurisdictions, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, and our results of operations would be adversely impacted. For example, we, along with certain other companies, app-based drivers, and community groups, are supporting a campaign for a 2022 ballot initiative in Massachusetts that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits for Dashers in Massachusetts. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could still be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California Superior Court challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in the Alameda County Superior Court\u2019s order noted above (which is being appealed), and similar challenges may also be filed. In addition, we could face further challenges to the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors as other states where we operate are considering adopting similar legislation or regulations. A reclassification of Dashers or delivery service providers using a local logistics platform as\nemployees could require us to revise our pricing methodologies and pay model to account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other substantive internal adjustments to account for any transition of a Dasher to an employment position, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term financial results and may yield results that conflict with the market\u2019s expectations, which could result in our stock price being adversely affected.\nWe are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on driving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-quality support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business decisions that may reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our goals to improve the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our geographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. For example, employee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquarters and in a number of our offices across the United States and internationally. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. We will need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure in order to manage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations.\nA majority of our employees have been with us for fewer than twenty-four (24) months. We have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and sales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large number of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand and any failure to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our ability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network effects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract and retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform and will only become more important as competition in our industry further intensifies. Successfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our reputation and brand and increasing the local network effects of our platform will depend on the success of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality services and support, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the \u201cDoorDash\u201d mark, our logo, and other trademarks important to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our platform, which in turn drives new consumer growth and engagement, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Our consumers have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods, including other local logistics platforms and services, and consumer preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our consumer base, we must appeal to new consumers who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or other local logistics platforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be adversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize our platform or our competitors\u2019 platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Negative perception of our platform or company may harm our reputation, brand, and local network effects, including as a result of:\n\u2022complaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, services or items provided through our platform, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines, including Dasher pay;\n\u2022missing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\n\u2022fraud;\n\u2022illegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\n\u2022food tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\n\u2022a pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network become infected;\n\u2022a failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or to pay Dashers competitively;\n\u2022a failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\n\u2022a failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\n\u2022a failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\n\u2022actual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact the reliability of our services;\n\u2022litigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\n\u2022users\u2019 lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\n\u2022changes to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our values or mission, or not clearly articulated;\n\u2022a failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022changes to our practices with respect to collection and use of consumer, merchant and Dasher data;\n\u2022a failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\n\u2022a failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\n\u2022inadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\n\u2022illegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\n\u2022negative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\n\u2022a failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\n\u2022perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee, merchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; or\n\u2022any of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects the public\u2019s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network effects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and new merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to be reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform, we may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform, any of which we expect would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our platform and balance the needs and interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may be viewed positively from one group\u2019s perspective but negatively from another group\u2019s perspective, or may not be viewed positively by any group. If we fail to balance the interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers or make changes that they view negatively, merchants, consumers, and Dashers may stop or reduce usage of our platform or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of media coverage from time to time. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, pay model, user support, technology, platform changes, platform quality, delivery issues, privacy or security practices, management team or the safety of Dashers, merchants and consumers using our platform could adversely affect our reputation. Such negative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and loyalty of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which Dashers were compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general food safety and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers and merchants using our platform, which has adversely affected our reputation and brand. As our platform continues to scale and public awareness of our brand increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an amplified negative effect on our reputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands or influencers that we have partnered with may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is not directly related to us. Any negative publicity that we may receive could diminish confidence in, and the use of, our platform, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any actual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our brand, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and proprietary data relating to our business, such as our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our employees. An increasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks. In addition, these incidents could originate on our vendors\u2019 platforms, vendors\u2019 systems, or with our vendors\u2019 personnel, which could then be leveraged to access our website, platforms, and proprietary data, including personal data. We and our vendors have previously experienced these types of breaches and other incidents. For example, in September 2019, we reported an incident affecting one of our vendors that resulted in the unauthorized acquisition of certain Dashers\u2019 driver licenses as well as data related to certain of our consumers. This incident has resulted in regulatory inquiries and is the subject of litigation. To date, this incident has not resulted in a material loss of revenue or the incurrence of material expenses. We have undertaken steps to enhance our data security and governance program, which include adding additional protective security layers around the data, improving security protocols that govern access to our systems, and bringing in outside expertise to increase our ability to identify and repel threats. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of the incident have been identified and remediated or will not lead to recurrence or similar incidents. While we maintain cyber insurance that may help provide coverage for these types of incidents, we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover costs and liabilities related to this incident or to any incidents which may occur in the future. In addition, in December 2021, a vulnerability in a popular logging software, Log4j, was publicly announced. If left unpatched, the Log4j vulnerability could be exploited to allow unauthorized actors to execute code remotely on a system using Log4j. We have taken steps to ensure these vulnerabilities have been patched in our systems, but we cannot guarantee that all vulnerabilities have been patched in every system upon which we are dependent or that additional critical vulnerabilities of Log4j or other open-source software upon which we rely will not be discovered.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we and our vendors may face delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, security breaches and other incidents. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or facilities used in our business through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology, or IT, systems, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants, or others into manipulating payment information, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. Moreover, with many of our employees and contractors and many employees and contractors of vendors currently working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be exposed to increased risks of security breaches or incidents.\nIn addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platform but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches experienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. We have previously experienced incidents of fraud on our platform that we believe involve credential stuffing attacks, which we have been unable to detect or prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored or supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect, remediate, and otherwise respond to.\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect the personal data of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, protect our systems, prevent data loss, and prevent other security breaches and security incidents, these security measures have not fully protected our systems in the past and cannot guarantee security in the future. The IT and infrastructure used in our business may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, viruses, social engineering, bugs, defects, vulnerabilities, denial of service, credential stuffing, ransomware and other malware and malicious code, employee error and malfeasance, and other sources of disruption or interruption of such IT and infrastructure, or security breaches or incidents, and unauthorized parties may be able to access data, including personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, our employees\u2019 personal data, or our other sensitive and proprietary data, accessible through those systems. Although we have policies restricting the access to the personal data we store, there is a risk that these policies may not be effective in all cases. Any actual or perceived breach of privacy, or any actual or perceived security breach or other incidents, could interrupt our operations, result in our platform being unavailable, result in loss or improper access to, unavailability of, acquisition, disclosure, modification or other processing of, data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation, brand, and competitive position, damage our relationships with third-party partners, or result in claims, regulatory investigations, and proceedings and significant legal, regulatory, and financial exposure, including ongoing monitoring by regulators, and any such incidents or any perception that our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny actual or perceived breach of privacy or security, or other security incident, impacting any entities with which we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party technology providers and vendors) could have similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors\u2019 security measures is limited. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our vendors\u2019 systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other disruption to, our or our vendors\u2019 systems.\nAlso, applicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property, such as our trade secrets and other proprietary data. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law effective in December 2021 that would require us to provide customer data, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses and delivery addresses, to restaurant merchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a customer opts out. Furthermore, this could result in certain consumers receiving unsolicited outreach from merchants as a result of this data sharing, which could lead to a negative consumer experience. We have filed a lawsuit challenging this law, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against us during the pendency of the litigation. If our lawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an adverse effect on our intellectual property or result in harm to our reputation or brand. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived security or privacy breaches or other incidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce confidence in us. We also expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent privacy and security breaches and other incidents, and we may face increased costs and expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived privacy or security breach or other incident.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any privacy or security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities incurred relating to any privacy or security breach or incident, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe markets for local food delivery logistics and our other delivery logistics services are still in relatively early stages of growth, and if these markets do not continue to grow, grow slower than we expect, or fail to grow as large as we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe local food delivery logistics market has grown rapidly since we launched our local logistics platform in 2013, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all. In addition, the market for the other delivery logistics services we facilitate, such as grocery delivery services, is also relatively nascent, and it is uncertain whether demand for grocery delivery services or other delivery logistics services we may facilitate in the future will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance, if at all. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt local food delivery logistics and the other delivery logistics services we facilitate. If the public does not perceive these services as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors\u2019 platforms or otherwise, or instead adopts alternative solutions that may arise, then the market for our platform may not further develop, may develop slower than we expect, or may not achieve the growth potential we expect, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not occurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the activities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services offered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating consumers or Dashers or the activities of Dashers while making deliveries to our consumers, have occurred, and in the future may occur, which could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. These activities include food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, assault, battery, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of consumer accounts, registering Dasher accounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such activities may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business interruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, referral fraud by both consumers and Dashers, fraud with respect to background checks, fraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, attempted payments by consumers with insufficient funds, fraud committed by consumers in concert with Dashers, and account takeovers of Dasher accounts by bad actors. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person\u2019s identity, account information, or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information, and mobile phone numbers. For example, bad actors have created Dasher accounts using other people\u2019s stolen personal identifying information to commit fraud on our platform and for other illicit purposes. Among other things, this has caused Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not performing services as Dashers. We have launched a series of initiatives and products changes to help prevent these practices.\nUnder current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to adequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or regulatory action, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of activities, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity by these parties from occurring and such conduct could expose us to liability, including through litigation, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. For example, Dashers whose accounts we have deactivated from our platform may nevertheless find a way to create a new account on our platform and perform deliveries. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from using our platform, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the growth and engagement of the number of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be adversely affected. In addition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which enables merchants on our Marketplace to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are retained directly by merchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in any of the other activities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on\nour platform. Further, any negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our platform or on our competitors\u2019 platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated with these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which includes facilitating deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less operationally efficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner merchants\u2019 systems. For example, for orders with most partner merchants, Dashers have an expedited checkout process that does not require a separate payment in store, but for orders with non-partner merchants, Dashers may have to place and pay for the order separately in store. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each order, more time and manual processes needed to place each order, and a higher likelihood of errors. Further, we sometimes unintentionally incorrectly price non-partner goods on our platform as a result of inaccuracies that occur when capturing menu prices. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated with facilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and cause damage to our reputation and brand. While our goal is to convert non-partner merchants into partner merchants, our inability to do so at a sufficiently high rate, or at all, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, some non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed. While we honor these requests, removing non-partner merchants impacts our ability to provide a broad selection of merchants. In addition, there is a risk that non-partner merchants bring legal claims against us relating to their inclusion on our platform. For example, in 2015, In-N-Out Burger filed a complaint against us claiming unfair competition, among other claims, and sought a permanent injunction to stop us from delivering their food. There is also a risk that state or local law is enacted to prevent platforms like ours from including non-partners on the platform. For example, the California Legislature passed legislation, California Assembly Bill 2149 (\u201cAB 2149\u201d), which was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and became effective on January 1, 2021. AB 2149 prohibits, among other things, food delivery logistics platforms from facilitating deliveries from restaurants in California without the restaurants\u2019 prior consent. Similar prohibitions have also been enacted in jurisdictions where we operate including Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Arkansas, Virginia, Washington, DC, Nevada, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island, New York, Colorado, and New Hampshire and are being contemplated in other jurisdictions. Beyond regulatory restrictions, we may also adopt internal policies that limit or prohibit the facilitation of deliveries from merchants without their prior consent. For example, in November 2020, we adopted internal policies pursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for delivery on our platform in the United States and such policies require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner restaurants on our platform in the United States to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with DoorDash. In the future, based on a variety of factors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may continue to revise and update our internal policies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the extent we are required or we choose to remove non-partner merchants for any reason, this will adversely affect our ability to attract and retain consumers and could directly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we are not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and results of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain competitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our website and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. If we fail to expand the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform, or if we fail to continuously enhance and improve our existing merchant services, our ability to retain and acquire merchants could be adversely affected. If competitors introduce new offerings embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing technology, services, website, and mobile applications may become obsolete. Our future success could depend on our ability to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted in, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and launching enhancements to our platform and new services on our platform may involve significant technical risks and upfront capital investments that may not generate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to\nadapt to emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced platform features and services or if our recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new merchants, consumers, and Dashers and can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts currently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising, television, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified advertisement websites, mobile \u201cpush\u201d communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may be difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset the additional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective, we expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide high-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide effective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are not only qualified to support users of our platform but are also well versed in our platform. As we continue to grow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support services at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of international users on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local logistics platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local logistics platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher efficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our local logistics platform and while we continue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology, including enhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and batching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the resulting gains in efficiency to our platform that we expect, or at all. Dasher pay is a major component of the cost of our business and subject to a number of risks, including changes to our Dasher pay model. The cost effectiveness of our local logistics platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological improvements do not reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and credits. If we are unable to maintain or improve the cost effectiveness of our local logistics platform, including with respect to Dasher efficiency and Dasher pay, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common stock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending and Dasher behavior patterns that have an impact on our growth and expenses. We may experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the calendar year, although our rapid growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made, and may continue to make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity can be impacted by colder or more inclement weather, which may increase consumer demand, and warmer or sunny weather, which may decrease consumer demand. In addition, the number of available Dashers may decrease during periods of inclement weather, but consumer demand during these times may require us to have more Dashers available to fulfill orders. During these times, we typically rely on incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which increases our costs. Further, severe weather in certain areas can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, and make it impossible for Dashers to make deliveries if roads are closed or difficult to drive on. In addition, we benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we experience a decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during summer breaks and other vacation periods, causing a similar decrease in Dasher pay. Seasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the existing seasonal trends that we experience may become more pronounced and contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations as we continue to scale and our growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our results of operations. However, we base our spending and investment plans on forecasts and estimates, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effects on consumer spending and merchant performance, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, inflation, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer purchases of discretionary items may decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. Economic conditions in certain regions may also be affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and threats to public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, like some of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely to use our platform. This risk is particularly pronounced with restaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have fewer merchants. In addition, because spending for purchases from many of the merchants on our platform is generally considered to be discretionary, we expect that any decline in consumer spending would have a disproportionate effect on our business relative to those businesses that sell products or services considered to be necessities. If spending at the merchants on our platform declines, consumers may be less likely to use our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages, inflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages at merchants could negatively impact their ability to fulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplace and in our Drive business. Inflationary pressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact consumer demand and drive lower order volume on our Marketplace and in our Drive business.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new local markets in which we have limited or no prior operating experience.\nOur capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete effectively in, new local markets. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict consumer preferences and purchasing habits in these new local markets. In addition, each market has unique regulatory dynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate, the pool of Dashers that are available, and our costs associated with insurance, support, fraud, and onboarding new Dashers. In addition, each market is subject to distinct competitive and operational dynamics. These include our ability to offer more attractive services than alternative options and our ability to efficiently attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect our sales, results of operations, and key business metrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to the changing dynamics in the local markets where we operate. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur presence outside the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\nWe have started expanding our presence internationally. For example, we launched our platform in Canada in 2015, in Australia in 2019, in Japan and Germany in 2021, and we expect to expand our international operations. particularly through the proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\"). Operating outside of the United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;\n\u2022an inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\n\u2022competition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\n\u2022differing demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\n\u2022complying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to labor and employment, data privacy, data protection, tax, and local regulatory restrictions;\n\u2022obtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\n\u2022varying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\n\u2022currency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022public health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in which we operate or may operate in the future; and\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject our business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility and geopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards, including with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions.\nIf we or our partners fail to develop and successfully commercialize autonomous or drone delivery technologies or fail to develop such technologies before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, change our cost structure materially, are inferior to those of our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those of our competitors or non-autonomous or non-drone delivery methods, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that autonomous and drone delivery technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact our industry. We have invested and we expect to continue to invest in research and development related to autonomous and drone delivery technologies, either directly or in partnership with companies that develop such technologies. While we believe that autonomous and drone delivery could present substantial opportunities, the development of such technologies is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. Autonomous and drone delivery technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Failures of our or our partners\u2019 autonomous or drone delivery technologies could generate substantial liability, create negative publicity, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, results of operations, and prospects. Even if our or our partners\u2019 efforts to develop autonomous and drone delivery technologies are successful, such efforts may not be cost-effective and there is no guarantee that such technologies can reduce our current costs of facilitating on-demand delivery services. Further, several other companies, including Uber and Amazon, are also developing autonomous and drone delivery technologies, either themselves or through collaborations, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the local logistics industry. Certain competitors may commercialize autonomous and drone delivery technologies at scale before we or our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone delivery to market before we do, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to our or our partners\u2019 technology, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, if competitors develop autonomous and drone delivery technologies that successfully reduce the cost of facilitating delivery logistics services, these competitors could offer their services at lower prices as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, we expect that governments will develop regulations that are specifically designed to apply to autonomous and drone technologies. These regulations could include requirements that significantly delay or narrowly limit the commercialization of autonomous and drone technologies, limit the amount of autonomous and drone delivery on our platform, or impose significant liabilities on manufacturers or operators of these solutions or developers of these technologies. Moreover, these regulations may affect our or our partners\u2019 ability to design and manufacture new autonomous or drone technologies. For example, commercial drone regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration limit the altitude, available airspace, and weight of a drone and also the certification of remote pilots that can operate a drone for commercial purposes in the United States. If regulations of this nature continue to be implemented, we or our partners may not be able to commercialize autonomous and drone delivery technologies in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or our partners are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous and drone solutions, we could become subject to substantial fines or penalties.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments that complement our business. For example, in November 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wolt, a local commerce platform based in Finland, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022. We have previously acquired and continue to evaluate targets that operate in relatively nascent markets, and as a result, there is no assurance that such acquired businesses will be successfully integrated into our business or generate substantial revenue.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase prices and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\n\u2022failure or material delay in closing a transaction;\n\u2022transaction-related lawsuits or claims;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts, and personnel of an acquired company;\n\u2022difficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\n\u2022difficulties in retaining merchants, consumers, and delivery service providers, as applicable, of an acquired company;\n\u2022challenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\n\u2022diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\n\u2022failure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\n\u2022risks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business;\n\u2022risks that regulatory bodies do not approve our acquisitions or business combinations or delay such approvals;\n\u2022theft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\n\u2022risk that an acquired company or investment in new services cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\n\u2022adverse market reaction to an acquisition.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. For example, in October 2021, we closed a $395 million investment in preferred shares of a private company based in Europe which provides an instant grocery delivery service. Strategic investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, regulatory, and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or competitive with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and may otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our investments may be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations. Entry into certain transactions with foreign entities now or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity was subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy. In addition, our investments are speculative in nature and may decline in value or be entirely lost.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments, or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain, manage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to grow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key technical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may not be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future. Also, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will basis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In addition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer, and we\nbelieve we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this or other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our employees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train, and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts, and employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action, has been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\n\u2022failure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values, and mission;\n\u2022the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\n\u2022competitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\n\u2022the continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\n\u2022the increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\n\u2022negative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; and\n\u2022the integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users\u2019 access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet. We may operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet connectivity, particularly as we expand internationally. Internet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with significant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers\u2019 ability to access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any particular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for a short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with\nthe SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement such processes and controls. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. To address this material weakness, we hired additional accounting, engineering, and business intelligence personnel and implemented process level and management review controls to identify and address emerging risks. While we believe this material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2020, we cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing material weaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls and systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting, do not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, additional weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC commencing with this annual report on Form 10-K. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAdditionally, commencing with this annual report on Form 10-K, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and to enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more complex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers attempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of third-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of software updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from third-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue, and access or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have implemented \u201csell-to-cover\u201d in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf of RSU holders upon vesting and/or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result in dilution to our stockholders. We also permit certain RSU holders to elect to cover the RSU tax withholding liabilities by providing to us a cash payment amount.\nTo fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting and/or settlement of RSUs, we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would otherwise be issued with respect to such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash (which may include cash generated from the proceeds of the IPO) to satisfy such tax obligations, (ii) have the holders of such RSUs use a broker or brokers to sell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement date, with the proceeds of such sales to be delivered to us for remittance to the relevant taxing authorities, in order to satisfy such tax withholding and remittance obligations, or (iii) allow certain holders of such RSUs to pay us an amount in cash, via a broker, sufficient to cover the applicable RSU tax withholding obligations. The tax withholding due in connection with such RSU vesting and settlement will be based on the then-current value of the underlying shares of our Class A common stock, and we would expect to withhold and remit the tax withholding liabilities at the applicable statutory rates on behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities in cash. If we withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would otherwise be issued with respect to the vesting and/or settlement of RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations, this may result in significant cash expenditures by us. We have implemented \u201csell-to-cover\u201d to satisfy tax withholding obligations, pursuant to which shares with a market value equivalent to the tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales are remitted by us to the taxing authorities. Such sales or any cash amount that the holder provides to us to cover the applicable RSU tax withholding obligations, in either case, will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the tax withholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the extent a large number of shares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts and key business and non-GAAP metrics such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy of our operating metrics could be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement measures to detect and prevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the number of consumers on our platform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, we expect that our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\nMany members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituencies will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. We maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors. However, Dashers may be reclassified as employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on service provider classification and their potential impact on the local logistics industry. A reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service providers as employees would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including as a result of:\n\u2022monetary exposure arising from, or relating to failure to, withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and hour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide required breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including related to the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (\u201cPAGA\u201d) and government fines;\n\u2022injunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\n\u2022claims for employee benefits, social security, workers\u2019 compensation, and unemployment;\n\u2022claims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\n\u2022claims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\n\u2022other claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees, including risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\n\u2022harm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service providers as employees would require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability to add and retain Dashers to our platform and grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 ruling in Dynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for example, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify Dashers as independent contractors. The San Francisco District Attorney also sought a preliminary injunction that would have barred us from continuing to classify Dashers in California as independent contractors during the pendency of this case. The request for the preliminary injunction was withdrawn in December 2020. We believe we have meritorious defenses, despite the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In addition, in 2017, we settled one classification matter in California on a class basis including claims raised under PAGA and in 2022 we settled a similar classification matter covering Massachusetts and California Dashers including claims raised under PAGA.\nSome jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to determine worker classification. Further, the California Legislature passed AB 5 and it was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for Dashers, which passed in November 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court in California issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General and other groups and individuals have filed notices of appeal to the California Court of Appeal. As a result, to the extent\nProposition 22 remains in effect pending further court proceedings, as such, certain provisions regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in California and our costs related to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, we do in certain circumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs could also lead to a lower Net Revenue Margin, which we previously referred to in past SEC filings as Take Rate, defined as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV. The provisions resulting from Proposition 22 that are now applicable to us include, but are not limited to, (i) net earnings (which excludes tips, tolls, and certain other amounts) to Dashers no less than a net earnings floor equal to (A) 120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher\u2019s engaged time and (B) for Dashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per engaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for inflation after 2021) and (ii) for Dashers averaging at least fifteen (15) hours per week of engaged time during a calendar quarter who subscribe to a qualifying health plan, payments to such Dashers of healthcare subsidies of varying dollar amounts depending on a Dasher\u2019s engaged time per week. As such, Proposition 22 is likely to have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, several jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in ongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work that Dashers perform. To the extent other states adopt such legislation, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could still be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California Superior Court challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in the Alameda County Superior Court\u2019s order noted above (which is being appealed), and similar challenges may also be filed. Furthermore, if Dashers are determined to be employees in other states or under federal law, this could result in even higher increases to our costs related to Dashers, which would likely lead us to increase fees and commissions even more and may result in further lower order volumes. To the extent Dashers are determined to be employees under other state or federal law, we would be required to significantly alter our existing business model and operations, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability, expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our business generally, and with the food delivery services we facilitate in particular, including potential claims related to food offerings, delivery, and quality.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, and other legal, regulatory, and other administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints, intellectual property disputes, marketing and advertising to consumers and Dashers, compliance with regulatory requirements, and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the actions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents caused by Dashers that utilize our platform. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation, and to prevent the uncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we face increasing public scrutiny. In addition, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages or alcohol consumption. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any consumers, Dashers, or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. Coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to potential legal claims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could do so in the future as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that generate a significant percentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our business. The potential for acts of terrorism on the United States or international food supply also exists and, if such an event occurs, it could harm our business and results of operations. Further, food that is ordered through our platform could be subject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to\nensure compliance with a food recall. In addition, reports of food-borne illnesses, food recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our platform, could, as a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative actions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as well as our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including the background check process, and the nature and frequency of our communications to Dashers via email, text, or telephone. In addition, we also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class actions, by consumers relating to, among other things, our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the local food delivery logistics services we facilitate, discrepancies between the menus on our website and consumer mobile application and the menus at the restaurant from which the food is delivered, including discrepancies in menu items and the prices of such items and taxes on such items, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or telephone.\nIn addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our website and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and negligence, among others. We also face potential liability and expense for claims arising from a data security incident, including claims regarding the adequacy and timeliness of our response to such an incident and our notification to affected consumers and Dashers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, or other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant management attention, and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These proceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or other orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and current and former directors and officers.\nIn addition, we include arbitration and class action waiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as they can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration can be costly and burdensome, and the use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation and brand, we may limit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure. Additionally, we permit certain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which could also cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class action waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federal law, there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental\nstatutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to local logistics businesses generally.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. Such taxes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we operate, such as Canada and Australia, and we may face various indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise questions about, or challenge or disagree with, our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage merchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the appropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally, if merchants try to pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to consumers, order volume may decline. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition would be harmed.\nUnder state tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain states. Our responsibility for these taxes may be applicable to past sales and could be applicable to the cost of goods or fees charged on our platform. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use, or other taxes or remitting such taxes directly to states could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales and additional administrative expenses. These taxes could also increase the cost for consumers using our platform. Any of the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate, collect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related legislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain states have enacted laws that would require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on items sold online. Requiring tax reporting or collection could decrease merchant, consumer, or Dasher activity, which would harm our business. This new legislation could require us or Dashers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlso, the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee taxpayer information and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a failure to comply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a percentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to the large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these reporting obligations could result in financial liability and other consequences to us if we were unable to remedy such failures in a timely manner.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is determined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Increases in our effective tax rate would reduce profitability or increase losses.\nAs we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the United States or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, income earned by us and our subsidiaries may be subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction, such as the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of us or the applicable subsidiary as well as the jurisdiction from which such income is derived. This may result in double taxation if relief is not available under applicable domestic or non-U.S. law or an applicable tax treaty. Any double taxation may impact the financial results of our operations.\nWe have been subject to examination, and may be subject to examination in the future, by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. While we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority would not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain risks relating to employment taxes and sales taxes are described in more detail under \u201c- If Dashers in the United States are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\u201d and \u201c- Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\u201d\nIn addition, regulatory or legislative developments may also arise from the proposed U.S. tax reform under the Biden Administration, which has proposed a new corporate alternative minimum tax and increased taxation of international business operations. There is uncertainty regarding what changes, if any, will be enacted and the effect on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had accumulated $4,125 million and $3,265 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, (\"NOLs\"), respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will begin to expire in 2036 for federal and 2024 for state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5 percent stockholders\u201d that exceeds fifty (50) percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D credit carryforwards, to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes that may occur in the future. Prior to the utilization of NOLs in the future, we will determine whether there are any limitations under Section 382 of the Code.\nThere is also a risk that due to changes in applicable law or regulatory changes (such as suspensions on the use of NOLs and other tax attributes by certain jurisdictions, including in order to raise additional revenue to help counter the fiscal impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly with retroactive effect) or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs and other tax attributes could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and other tax attributes.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those related to worker classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims.\nThe local delivery logistics industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or may become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to worker classification, Dasher pay, insurance, and pricing and commissions. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues such as worker classification or our relationship with Dashers on our platform more generally (for example, those concerning Dasher pay, insurance requirements, and other aspects of our relationship with Dashers), labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products, online credit card payments, gratuities, pricing and commissions, text messaging, membership services, intellectual property, data retention, privacy, data security, consumer protection, background checks, website and mobile application accessibility, and tax are\noften complex, subject to change, and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable to us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting, including varying standards and interpretations between state and federal law, between individual states, and even at the city and municipality level. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. We have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform is available broadly in the United States and foreign jurisdictions including Canada and Australia.\nAdditionally, laws relating to the potential liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition, regulatory authorities in the United States at the federal and state level are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and other matters that may be applicable to our business. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, as with our November 2021 launch in Germany, we would become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how existing laws would be applied to our business and the new laws to which it may become subject.\nRecent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory and administrative bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business, including by changing employment-related laws or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses like ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, over fifty (50) jurisdictions across the United States, including many jurisdictions in California, have implemented temporary price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, some jurisdictions have enacted permanent price controls, including San Francisco, California, New York, New York, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Minneapolis, Minnesota (although the latter two jurisdictions\u2019 price restrictions do not apply when certain conditions are met). We filed litigation challenging the San Francisco and New York price controls as unconstitutional and in excess of each respective jurisdiction\u2019s police power. There are legislative proposals in additional jurisdictions to make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals to be made in the future. These price controls have had in the past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These price controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers, though we are aware of multiple jurisdictions which have adopted explicit limits or prohibitions against doing so in connection with price controls, which could further increase our costs. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we categorize or collect such increased consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as confusing and/or misleading to consumers. Although temporary price controls in some jurisdictions in which we operate have expired, with the continued duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect existing price controls to persist in the near term and for additional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If any of these events occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which creates additional challenges to managing our business.\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses that perceive our business model negatively to raise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to change such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of merchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, including any future laws or obligations that we may not be able to anticipate at this time, we could be adversely affected, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain services or platform features, which would adversely affect our business. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, fines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred to prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and other anticorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both domestic and abroad. These laws generally prohibit us and our employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain business, direct business to any person, or gain any improper advantage. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also may hold us liable for acts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are acting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible, and our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management\u2019s attention, a drop in our stock price, or overall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and future laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce, or other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business practices, or raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue to evolve, may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content, copyrights, distribution, social media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and other taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally, it is possible that foreign government entities may seek to censor content available on our mobile applications or website or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and website. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand, a loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the users on our platform, as well as other personal data relating to individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal, and international laws and regulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain types of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Law, Australia\u2019s Privacy Act, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the \u201cTCPA\u201d). Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d). These laws, rules, and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, among other things, requires disclosures to California consumers, imposes obligations on businesses that process California consumers' personal information, and\naffords such consumers new rights, including the ability to opt out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information, which could increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation.\nThe CCPA continues to evolve and could require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and expose us to further regulatory or operational burdens. Also, the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d) was approved by California voters and significantly modifies the CCPA, resulting in further uncertainty and likely requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CPRA has created obligations relating to personal information as of January 1, 2022, Other states have also enacted or proposed similar privacy laws. For example in March 2021, Virginia enacted a Consumer Data Protection Act that will go into effect January 1, 2023, and Colorado enacted a Colorado Privacy Act that will go into effect July 1, 2023. Both of these laws differ from the CPRA, Similar laws are being considered by other state legislatures. This legislation and other proposed laws may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of data and could result in increased compliance costs or changes in business practices and policies. In addition, all 50 states have laws including obligations to provide notification of security breaches involving personal data to affected individuals, state officers and others.\nMoreover, we will become subject to additional countries\u2019 privacy laws as we expand our international operations. For example, with our November 2021 launch in Germany, we became subject to the GDPR, which imposes strict requirements relating to the processing of personal data. European Union (\"EU\") member states have enacted legislation that adds to or interprets the GDPR requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to the United States as well as other countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data. The GDPR also afford greater control for data subjects (for example, the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability for data subjects, and data breach notification requirements. Noncompliance is subject to significant penalties, which can include fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects.\nIn addition to laws and regulations, we are subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which requires companies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection or any loss, unavailability or inadvertent or unauthorized use, modification, disclosure, or other processing of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA, CPRA and GDPR imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so.\nAdditionally, our success depends, in part, on our ability to access, collect and use data about and relating to Dashers, merchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as \u201ccookies,\u201d is further restricted, regulated or blocked, the amount or accuracy of Internet user information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business and results of operations. Federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the practice of online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes. U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have enacted, have considered, or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. For example, the European Commission has proposed a draft regulation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (the \u201cePrivacy Regulation\u201d), which would replace the current ePrivacy Directive. If adopted, the earliest date for entry into force is in 2023, with broad potential impacts on the use of Internet-based services and tracking technologies, such as cookies. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with the requirements of the ePrivacy Regulation and national implementation laws once they are enacted. In addition to the EU, other regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral advertising ecosystem. For example, the CCPA grants California consumers the right to opt-out of a company\u2019s sharing of personal information for advertising purposes in exchange for money or other valuable consideration. Moreover, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block tracking technologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could, if widely adopted, significantly reduce the\neffectiveness of such practices and technologies. For example, Apple introduced an iOS update in April 2021 that allowed users to more easily opt-out of tracking activity across devices, which has impacted and may continue to impact business. As a result, we may have to develop alternative systems to determine our customers\u2019 behavior, customize their online experience or efficiently market to them.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors or merchants on our platform, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal data or other data relating to Dashers, consumers, or other individuals, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing Dashers and consumers from using our platform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of automated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil claims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Consumers (Topic 606)\u201d (\u201cASC 606\u201d), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, and in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842)\u201d (\u201cASC 842\u201d), which increases lease transparency and comparability among organizations. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies to insure our operations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including auto liability, employment practices liability, workers\u2019 compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business liabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving services, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of insurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of these merchant agreements.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we would bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured retentions, or\notherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided or (v) the number of claims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third party and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers. Under our commercial agreement with Stripe, Stripe may terminate the relationship with advanced notice. If Stripe terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find an alternate payment processor and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable timeframe. Further, the software and services provided by Stripe may not meet our expectations, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of time, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nNearly all payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we accept from our consumers, including with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy, and information security. If we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable regulations, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely on data provided by Stripe for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in such data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable law, we could become subject to certain laws, rules, and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and numerous state and local agencies that may define money transmitter differently. For example, certain states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we could be subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations governing our business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we are not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain services to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations on a single datacenter provided by Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS\u2019s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS\u2019 service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users on our platform. Since our platform\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand and the usage of our platform increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our platform. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant short-term loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate the agreement for convenience by providing us at least thirty (30) days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice. Even though our platform is entirely in the cloud, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud infrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime for a short period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers. However, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers would cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations over the longer term.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide accurate information or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal and/or driving records of potential Dashers and, in some cases, existing Dashers to help identify those that are not qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the requirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable timeframe. In certain jurisdictions, including the United States, we rely on a single third-party background check provider for these jurisdictions. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to potential Dashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our expectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we may be unable to adequately protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and qualified Dashers may be inadvertently excluded from our platform. For example, we had a Dasher who had a criminal conviction that should have excluded him from using our platform who was nonetheless cleared by one of our background check providers, and as a result, we allowed him to make deliveries on our platform and he was subsequently alleged to cause personal injury to a merchant on our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-party background check has been conducted, we may not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making deliveries on our platform. In addition, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, we could face legal liability or negative publicity.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing Dashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative actions. For example, we have faced non-material issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related to notice requirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be limited in certain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we decide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. By choosing background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or regulation, or by failing to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative publicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to safety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. From time to time we have had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of our third-party software providers. If, in connection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its relationship with us or otherwise limits the provision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our platform could be disrupted. If the third parties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Dashers use, whether in connection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not control.\nWe have integrations with Stripe, Salesforce, Twilio, Wavefront, Snowflake, Olo, third-party offerings such as Google Maps and AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-party applications, products, and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our platform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform. As our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of competition we face to increase. Should any of our competitors or merchants on our platform modify their technologies, standards, or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment to our competitors\u2019 products or services, our platform, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers. If we do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that reduce the effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could decline and our business, financial results, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. Any changes in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our applications or give preferential treatment to our competitors\u2019 applications could adversely affect our platform\u2019s usage on mobile devices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors\u2019 placement in such mobile operating systems\u2019 application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our applications, our user growth could slow. Our applications have experienced fluctuations in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our applications. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users\u2019 experience. If merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, we expect that our user growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about users of our platform, including merchants, consumers and Dashers. For example, Apple has imposed new requirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and has implemented a new application tracking transparency framework that requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. These changes have, and we expect that these changes will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions because they will limit our visibility into the performance of specific advertising channels. If we are unable to mitigate the effects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as well as order rates from existing consumers on our platform, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new consumer growth could decline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected if we fail to appear prominently in search results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search engines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is due in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes their own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search engines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher advertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of consumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information from third-party sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such sources or the methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and information may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including general expectations concerning our industry and the market in which we operate, category share, market opportunity, and market size, are based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or the methodologies for collecting such data. If there are any limitations or errors with respect to such data or methodologies, or if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, our reputation, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual property on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we share information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or technology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or successfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through various methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be inadequate. Also, applicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property, such as our trade secrets and other proprietary information. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law which went into effect in December 2021 that would require us to provide customer data, such as names, phone numbers, emails and delivery addresses, to restaurants merchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a customer opts out. We have filed a lawsuit challenging this law, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against us during the pendency of the litigation. If our lawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an adverse effect on our intellectual property or result in harm to our reputation or brand.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term \u201cDoorDash\u201d in the United States, Canada, and other jurisdictions. Competitors have and may continue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or register our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property. Our efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the future may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay substantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising from such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The defense of\nthese claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent or copyright rights, cease making, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend additional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license intellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand, trademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, most importantly www.doordash.com. If we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable registration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name, which could cause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in question. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names outside the United States due to a variety of reasons. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names similar to ours. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. Protecting, maintaining, and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or modified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the licensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that source code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software license. This could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial time, and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software until we can adequately address the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are designed to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be effective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our platform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our operations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new platform features and services or enhance our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. We believe our working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve (12) months and beyond. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility includes a number of covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock, make investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies which are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving credit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of DoorDash Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between the Co-Founders has the effect of concentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has twenty (20) votes per share, and our Class C common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. The Co-Founders together hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2021, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer Engineering, and a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of our board of directors collectively held 66% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate, which voting power may increase over time as the Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards (including those equity awards granted to the Co-Founders prior to the IPO and subject to equity exchange right agreements whereby each of the Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any shares of Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or the vesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock). If all such equity awards held by the Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had been exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of December 31, 2021, the Co-Founders would collectively hold 76% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. The Co-Founders have also entered into the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will be able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting power and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between the Co-Founders and our other stockholders, which may result in Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or the Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or other transfers among the Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one (1) share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than sixty-one (61) days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the number of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of the IPO, which we sometimes refer to herein as the \u201c35% Ownership Threshold\u201d; (ii) twelve (12) months after the death or permanent and total disability of Mr. Xu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as directed by a person designated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors(or if there is no such person, then our secretary then in office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than sixty-one (61) days and no more than 180 days following the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than sixty-one (61) days and no more than 180 days following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, or consultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu\u2019s voluntary resignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to be renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which such final conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation occurs as the \u201cFinal Conversion Date\u201d.\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per share (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further strategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers. Over time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders and this dilution could eventually\nresult in the Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of our total outstanding voting power. Once the Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting power, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock have no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting dilution, which would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common stock to Mr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares of Class C common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has been met. As a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu\u2019s control of our voting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to the Co-Founders and, in that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve liquidity in their holdings without diminishing Mr. Xu\u2019s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common stock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\").\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, we expect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail ourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, the Co-Founders collectively hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2021, and Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as that term is set forth in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange regarding corporate governance, including:\n\u2022the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022the requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance evaluation of the committee; and\n\u2022the requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee, and the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal advisors, or any other advisor retained by the committee.\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption. Although we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we do not currently expect to rely on these exemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with certain of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which could adversely affect the protections for other stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices. In July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater than 5% of the company\u2019s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it will no longer admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Also in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices and in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities \u201cwith unequal voting structures\u201d in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under such announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds,\nand other investment vehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\n\u2022the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of our competitors or others in our industry;\n\u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022actual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors, such as our announcement of the pending acquisition of Wolt;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022any significant change in our management;\n\u2022general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors\u2019 rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by them for public sale in the United States. In addition, we previously filed a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u2022any amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\n\u2022our amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required for stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\n\u2022our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to determine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock;\n\u2022our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\n\u2022until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the \u201c Voting Threshold Date \u201d), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022after the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\n\u2022our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\n\u2022vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n\u2022a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\n\u2022our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain\ncircumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. Nothing in our amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state or federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the Delaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts\u2019 estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Acquisition of Wolt\nThe proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\") will not be completed unless the conditions are satisfied or waived. If the Transaction is not completed, our and Wolt\u2019s future business and financial results could be negatively affected.\nOn November 9, 2021, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Wolt. Our and Wolt\u2019s obligations to consummate the Transaction are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. These conditions include, among other customary conditions, receipt of certain specified regulatory approvals, the absence of certain laws or orders prohibiting or making illegal the Transaction, effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844) registering the shares of our Class A common stock issuable to the Wolt shareholders and holders of outstanding and unexercised vested options to purchase shares of Wolt class A common stock (\"Wolt Vested Optionholders\", jointly referred to as \"Seller\") as consideration in the Transaction, approval of a prospectus under Finnish law by the Finnish authorities, if required pursuant to applicable laws, execution of an escrow agreement by the parties and an escrow agent related to the escrow of certain shares to secure the Sellers\u2019 indemnification obligations, no event occurring that had or would reasonably be expected to result in a DoorDash Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the DoorDash Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844)) or a Wolt Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the DoorDash Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844)), compliance by the parties with their covenants in the Share Purchase Agreement, dated November 9, 2021 (the \"Share Purchase Agreement\") in all material respects, the accuracy of representations and warranties made by us or Wolt, and certain conditions related to key employees and the lockup agreements entered into by certain Wolt stockholders (the \u201cLockup Agreements\").\nIn addition, if the Transaction is not completed by the termination date specified in the Share Purchase Agreement, or certain other events have occurred that prevent the closing conditions from being satisfied, either we or Wolt may choose to terminate the Share Purchase Agreement. We or Wolt may also elect to terminate the Share Purchase Agreement in certain other circumstances, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Share Purchase Agreement at any time prior to the closing of the Transaction. There is no assurance that the Transaction will be consummated.\nIf the Transaction is delayed, terminated or otherwise not completed, DoorDash and Wolt would not realize any of the expected benefits of the Transaction and may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our or Wolt\u2019s business, results of operations and stock price, including, among others:\n\u2022under certain circumstances, we could be required to pay a termination fee of \u20ac210 million;\n\u2022DoorDash and Wolt will have incurred and may continue to incur costs relating to the Transaction, including, as applicable, professional fees and expenses, fees and costs relating to regulatory filings and notices, and other transaction-related costs, fees and expenses. These costs are payable by DoorDash and Wolt whether or not the Transaction is complete. If the Transaction is not completed, DoorDash and Wolt will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received by DoorDash or Wolt;\n\u2022matters related to the Transaction (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our and Wolt\u2019s management teams and numerous others throughout our and Wolt\u2019s organizations, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities;\n\u2022we may acquire a majority but less than all of the outstanding shares in the Transaction, which may result in obligations to the minority shareholders of Wolt or additional expenses and obligations in connection with, and following, the Transaction;\n\u2022DoorDash and Wolt may be subject to legal proceedings related to the Transaction or the failure to complete the Transaction, which could be time consuming and expensive, could divert DoorDash's and Wolt\u2019s managements\u2019 attention away from their regular business and, if any lawsuit is adversely resolved against DoorDash or Wolt, could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition;\n\u2022a delay in completing the Transaction, or failure to complete the Transaction, negative perceptions about the Transaction, or other factors beyond DoorDash\u2019s and Wolt\u2019s control, may result in negative publicity and a negative perception of DoorDash and/or Wolt in the investment community, and could negatively impact on our stock price; and\n\u2022any disruptions to our or Wolt\u2019s businesses resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Transaction, including any adverse changes in DoorDash\u2019s or Wolt\u2019s relationships with their respective customers, suppliers, partners or employees, may continue to intensify in the event the Transaction is not consummated.\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt may subject us to certain liabilities associated with Wolt or liabilities that may arise in connection with the completion of the transaction.\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt with us may pose special risks, including write-offs or restructuring charges, unanticipated costs, and the loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that the integration will be accomplished effectively or in a timely manner. In addition, the Transaction and the integration of Wolt will subject us to liabilities that may exist at Wolt or may arise in connection with the completion of the Transaction, some of which may be unknown.\nAlthough we and our advisers have conducted due diligence on the operations of Wolt and we have certain rights of indemnification, including the escrow of shares to secure the Sellers\u2019 obligations, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of Wolt or that the amounts in escrow will be sufficient. Further, the escrow consists of shares and therefore, even if we are able to recover from the escrow, we will need to use our cash and resources to pay for the liabilities and damages. These liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to the transaction not currently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our profitability. Further, Wolt\u2019s business is different in certain ways from ours, and our results of operations may as a result be affected by factors that differ from those currently affecting our results of operations.\nOur and Wolt\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Transaction, which could have an adverse effect on our and Wolt\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nParties with which we and Wolt do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, Wolt or the combined company following the completion of the transaction. Our and Wolt\u2019s relationships may be subject to disruption as merchants, Dashers and couriers, and other persons with whom we and/or Wolt have a business relationship may have concerns about a larger, more international organization, or otherwise, and may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or Wolt, as applicable, or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us or Wolt. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of us, Wolt or the combined company following the completion of the transaction, including an adverse effect on our ability to realize the expected benefits of the transaction. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of or failure to complete the transaction.\nUncertainties associated with the Transaction may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, and DoorDash and the combined company may have difficulty attracting and motivating management personnel and other key employees, which could adversely affect the future businesses and operations of DoorDash and the combined company.\nDoorDash and Wolt are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective management personnel and other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company\u2019s success after the completion of the Transaction will depend in part upon the ability of DoorDash and Wolt to attract, motivate and retain key management personnel and other key employees. Prior to completion of the Transaction, current and prospective employees of DoorDash and Wolt may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the completion of the Transaction, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of DoorDash and Wolt to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees. In addition, no assurance can be given that DoorDash will be able to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees of DoorDash and Wolt to the same extent that DoorDash and Wolt have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees. If key employees terminate their employment, DoorDash\u2019s business activities may be adversely affected and management\u2019s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating DoorDash and Wolt to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause DoorDash\u2019s business to suffer.\nWolt is subject to numerous legal and regulatory regimes and the combined business could be harmed by changes to, or the interpretation or the application of, the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.\nWolt is also subject to a number of legal and compliance risks, and these risks may adversely affect the combined company after completion of the Transaction. Wolt operates in twenty-three (23) countries in Europe and Asia, including, among others, Japan, Finland, Denmark, Hungary, Germany and Israel. The international scope of Wolt\u2019s business requires us to comply with a wide range of EU-level, national and local laws and regulations, which may in certain cases diverge from or even conflict with each other.\nWolt\u2019s business principally consists of providing an online delivery logistics platform and enabling people to get the same Wolt delivery experience from virtually any type of merchant (which in the case of Wolt includes, among others, restaurants, grocery stores, retail shops or boutiques), including operating its own Wolt Market grocery stores. With the geographic expansion of DoorDash\u2019s business and that of its subsidiaries, including also Wolt after the consummation of the Transaction, into new markets, DoorDash will become subject to additional and changing legal, regulatory, tax, licensing, and compliance requirements and industry standards with respect to delivery logistics providers.\nIn countries where DoorDash and Wolt operate, legislators and regulatory authorities may introduce new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or introduce new legislation or regulations concerning the business of DoorDash and/or Wolt, e.g., the independent contractor model for couriers. Changes in government regulation of or successful challenges to the independent contractor model used by Wolt in certain markets may require Wolt to change its existing business models and operations.\u201d). Any additional regulatory scrutiny or changes in legal requirements may impose significant compliance costs and make it uneconomical for the combined company to continue to operate in all of the current markets or to expand in accordance with our strategy, particularly if regulations or their interpretations vary greatly or conflict between different operating countries. This may negatively impact Wolt\u2019s or our revenue and profitability by preventing our or Wolt\u2019s business from reaching sufficient scale in particular markets or having to change its business model or incur additional costs, which would adversely impact the combined company after the completion of the transaction. Our inability, or perceived inability, to comply with existing or new compliance obligations, could lead to regulatory scrutiny, which could result in administrative or enforcement action, such as fines, penalties, and/or enforceable undertakings and adversely affect the combined company after the completion of the transaction.\nThe Transaction and the expansion of the combined company may lead to an increase in competitive pressure from both existing competitors and new entrants in the already highly competitive food delivery logistics industry.\nAs a result of the Transaction, DoorDash, through the operations of Wolt, will operate in a greater geographical area than it does currently. A number of competitors both in Europe and Asia offer food delivery logistics services similar to those offered by DoorDash and Wolt. Existing competitors and new entrants in this space in Europe and Asia may engage in aggressive consumer acquisition campaigns, develop superior offerings or consolidate with other entities and achieve benefits of scale. Such competitive pressures in an already highly competitive market may materially erode Wolt\u2019s existing market share and negatively impact Wolt\u2019s revenue, and may hinder Wolt\u2019s expansion into new markets, which could adversely impact the combined company after the completion of the transaction.\nFollowing the completion of the Transaction, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be increased.\nWe are currently subject to some foreign currency exchange risk because we conduct business operations in several foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which conduct business in their respective local currencies. Wolt conducts a significant portion of its operations outside of the United States through its subsidiaries or affiliates, which also operate in their respective local currencies, the most significant of which are currently the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Israeli Shekel. Therefore, following the completion of the Transaction, our international operations will account for a more significant portion of our overall operations than they do presently and our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase. Because our financial statements will continue to be presented in U.S. dollars subsequent to the completion of the transaction, the local currencies will be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, thereby increasing the foreign exchange translation risk.\nWe may be targeted by securities class action and derivative lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Transaction from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into share purchase agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Transaction, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Transaction from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. Currently, neither we nor Wolt is aware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits having been filed in connection with the Transaction.\nThe Transaction may be completed even though a material adverse effect may result from the announcement of the Transaction, industry-wide changes or other causes.\nIn general, either party can refuse to complete the Transaction if there is a DoorDash Material Adverse Effect or a Wolt Material Adverse Effect (each as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement) affecting the other party prior to the closing. However, some types of changes that would result in a material adverse effect of either party are excluded from the definitions of a DoorDash Material Adverse Effect or a Wolt Material Adverse Effect, and do not permit either party to\nrefuse to complete the Transaction. If such adverse changes occur but we and Wolt still complete the Transaction, the market price of our Class A common stock may suffer.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline as a result of the Transaction.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline as a result of the Transaction, if, among other things, we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the Transaction are not realized, or if the transaction costs related to the Transaction are greater than expected. The market price may also decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by investors or financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the Transaction on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of investors or financial or industry analysts. The issuance of shares of our Class A common stock in the Transaction could on its own have the effect of depressing the market price for our Class A common stock. In addition, many Wolt shareholders and Wolt Vested Optionholders may decide not to hold the shares of our Class A common stock they receive as a result of the Transaction. Other Wolt shareholders and Wolt Vested Optionholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our Class A common stock they receive as a result of the Transaction. Any such sales of our Class A common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our Class A common stock. Moreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, the our Class A common stock, regardless of the actual operating performance of the combined company.\nCompletion of the Transaction may trigger change in control, assignment or other provisions in certain agreements to which Wolt or its subsidiaries are a party, which may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe completion of the Transaction may trigger change in control, assignment and other provisions in certain agreements to which Wolt or its subsidiaries are a party. If DoorDash and Wolt are unable to negotiate waivers of, or consents under, those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements, seeking monetary damages or other remedies. Even if DoorDash and Wolt are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to DoorDash. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the businesses, financial condition and results of operations of DoorDash following the completion of the transaction, or the ability to successfully integrate their respective businesses and/or execute their respective strategies.",

    "item_3": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d) in the ordinary course of business, including suits by merchants, consumers, delivery providers, or other third parties (individually or as class actions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded.\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material administrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial position or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of third-party delivery providers on our platform as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that would apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us.\nWe are currently involved in a number of putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought under PAGA and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and other matters challenging the classification of third-party delivery providers on our platform as independent contractors.\nIn November 2019, we filed an agreement to pay $40 million with the representatives of Dashers that had filed certain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under PAGA and class action claims alleging worker misclassification of Dashers, or the Marciano settlement. These actions were filed by and on behalf of Massachusetts Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since August 2016. The settlement was filed with the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco on November 21, 2019. In April 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling raising certain issues with the filed settlement agreement and requesting supplemental briefing from the parties. In June 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and an amended settlement agreement to the court. The amended settlement agreement increased the total amount to be paid by us from $40 million to $41 million. In June 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling raising certain issues with the filed amended settlement agreement and requesting supplemental briefing from the parties. In July 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and an amended settlement agreement to the court. In August 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary approval of the amended settlement without prejudice and inviting the parties to file supplemental briefing addressing the concerns raised by the court. In October 2020, we entered into an amended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be paid by us from $41 million to $89 million. In November 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and the amended settlement agreement to the court. In February 2021, the court issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary approval of the amended settlement without prejudice. In April 2021, plaintiffs filed a notice of withdrawal of the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. In light of the court\u2019s concern about the plaintiffs releasing various class claims that were not originally pled in the Marciano action (which was filed as a PAGA-only case), the parties agreed not to seek a release of these claims in Marciano, but to instead present a new proposed settlement in Marko v DoorDash, Inc., Case No. BC659841 (Los Angeles Super. Ct.), where the court had jurisdiction over the various class claims under the Labor Code encompassed by the agreement. In April 2021, plaintiffs filed a revised settlement agreement with the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, or the Marko settlement. The total amount to be paid by us is $100 million. In January 2022, the court granted final approval of the Marko settlement which resolves claims under PAGA and claims alleging worker misclassification for Dashers in California for the period of August 30, 2016 through December 31, 2020 and claims alleging worker misclassification for Dashers in Massachusetts for the period of September 26, 2014 through March 31, 2021.\nMore than 35,000 delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed or expressed an intention to file arbitration demands against us that assert worker misclassification claims. As of December 31, 2021, individual settlement agreements have been executed and amounts paid thereunder, in an aggregate amount of approximately $83 million, including attorneys\u2019 fees, and covering approximately 31,000 delivery providers. We do not admit any allegations of wrongdoing as part of the resolution of these matters.\nVarious other delivery providers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their classification on our platform, as an independent contractor under federal and state law, seeking monetary, injunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual delivery providers, with many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our independent contractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to\nclassify Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform can continue to operate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions including Canada and Australia. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and related technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law in September 2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative titled Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for delivery providers, which passed in November 2020, and which became effective in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners consisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County Superior Court to compel the State of California not to enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as unconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda County Superior Court issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 have filed notices of appeal to the California Court of Appeal. Proposition 22 remains in effect pending further court proceedings.\nIn addition, several other states where we operate may adopt legislation similar to Proposition 22, which we would expect to increase our costs in such jurisdictions, could result in lower order volumes if we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, and could also adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation have been and may in the future be challenged and subject to litigation. Additionally, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to AB 5 to determine worker classification.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities, alleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws and other laws. In addition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and the Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our business practices, the classification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, compliance with consumer protection laws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development Department of the State of California for payroll tax liabilities. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, or inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly in the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs associated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the involved in Legal Proceedings where various parties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving delivery providers who have been active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving delivery providers that utilize our platform. In many of these matters, we believes we have meritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in our opinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and Legal Proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of management resources, and other factors.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nIn addition, the section of this \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 5, 2021.\nOverview\nWe have built a logistics and technology platform that enables local businesses to address consumers\u2019 expectations of ease and immediacy. We built our products to serve the needs of three key constituents: merchants, consumers, and Dashers. We do this primarily through our Marketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition and demand generation, order fulfillment, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand through delivery, generally facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by consumers. We also enable merchants to advertise and promote on our platform in order to acquire new consumers and drive incremental sales.\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our revenue today, our Platform Services business, which primarily consists of Drive and Storefront, offers services to help merchants facilitate sales through their own channels. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants to fulfill consumer demand generated through their own channels using our local logistics platform. Storefront enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nWe currently operate our business in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, and Germany.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 33,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at the public offering price of $102 per share. We received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of our shares in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. For additional information, see Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Developments\nOn November 9, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wolt. Headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, Wolt is a leading local commerce platform with operations in 23 countries across Europe, Japan, and Israel. We expect the acquisition of Wolt will increase our international scale, accelerate our product development, and improve our investment efficiency. The closing is expected in the first half of 2022, subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. We expect the acquisition of Wolt to increase our Marketplace GOV and revenue, as well as our costs and expenses.\nOn February 14, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an ordering and payment platform company domiciled in the United States for approximately $90 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\nKey Business and Non-GAAP Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key business and non-GAAP metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions:\n(1)Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information regarding our use of these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed on the DoorDash platform, including those completed through our Marketplace and Platform Services businesses, over the period of measurement.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Total Orders increased to 1.4 billion, or 70% growth compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Total Orders was driven by increased engagement of existing consumers, the addition of new consumers, and an increase in the number of orders completed through Platform Services businesses.\nMarketplace GOV. We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplace, including taxes, tips3, and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass. Marketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does not include the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through Drive and Storefront.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Marketplace GOV increased to $41.9 billion, or 70% growth compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, consistent with the growth in Total Orders.\nContribution Profit (Loss).4 We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Gross profit (loss) is defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue. We define Contribution Margin as Contribution Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue for the same period.\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Contribution Profit improved to $1.1 billion, compared to a Contribution Profit of $663 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by the growth in Marketplace GOV. In the year ended December 31, 2021, Contribution Margin decreased to 22%, compared to 23% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due to increases in Adjusted Cost of Revenue and Dasher acquisition costs.\nContribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certain limitations regarding its usefulness. It does not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP as it does not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution Profit (Loss) is not indicative of our overall results or an indicator of past or future financial performance. Further, it is not a financial measure of total company profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for total company profitability nor does it imply profitability for our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA.5 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) a one-time non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract related to the issuance of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, (iii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, (iv) transaction-related expense, (v) impairment expenses, (vi) provision for income taxes, (vii) interest income and expense, (viii) other income (expense), net, (ix) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (x) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the same period.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $289 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $189 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by the growth in Marketplace GOV. In the year ended December 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased to 6%, compared to 7% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to increases in Adjusted Cost of Revenue and Dasher acquisition costs.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplace and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are based on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our Marketplace to sell the partner merchants\u2019 products. Fees from consumers are for use of our Marketplace to arrange for delivery services.\n3 Dashers receive 100% of tips.\n4 For more information about Contribution Profit (Loss) and Contribution Margin, including the limitations of such measures, and a reconciliation of Contribution Profit (Loss) to gross profit (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\n5 For more information about Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, including the limitations of such measures and more detail on the specific adjustments, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, as well as a calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin, see the section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nWe recognize revenue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an agent for both partner merchants and consumers. Our revenue therefore reflects commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers less (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which includes certain discounts and incentives provided to consumers, including those for referring a new customer. Revenue from our Marketplace is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant\u2019s products.\nWe also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of our Marketplace revenue. Revenue generated from our DashPass memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including from our Platform Services business, which primarily consists of our Drive and Storefront offerings. We generate revenue from Drive by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant\u2019s products.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of rebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, insurance expenses, and costs related to placing orders with non-partner merchants, and costs related to first party product sales, for which we take control of inventory (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding merchants and Dashers, costs for providing support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform infrastructure costs, and (iii) personnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to our local operations, support, and other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation expenses primarily include salary, bonus, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is determined based on an allocation of shared costs, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and information technology costs, among all departments based on employee headcount.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant, consumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the referrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing expenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense including amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses related to data analytics and the design of, product development of, and improvements to our platform, as well as expenses associated with the licensing of third-party software and allocated overhead.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, tax, and regulatory expenses, which include litigation settlement expenses and sales and indirect taxes, personnel-related compensation expenses related to administrative employees, which include finance and accounting, human resources and legal, chargebacks associated with fraudulent credit card transactions, professional services fees, transaction-related expenses, bad debt expense, and allocated overhead.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our property and equipment and intangible assets. Depreciation primarily includes expenses associated with equipment for merchants, computer equipment and software, office equipment, and leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized software and website development costs, as well as acquired intangible assets.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest costs related to our revolving credit facility and payment-in-kind interest on our Convertible Notes issued in February 2020.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract liability (entered into and settled in the year ended December 31, 2019) in connection with the issuance of shares of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes primarily consists of U.S. federal and state income tax and franchise tax, as well as international taxes from foreign operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations data:\n(1)Costs and expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows:\n(2)Depreciation and amortization related to the following:\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:\nComparison of the Years Ended 2021 and 2020\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $2.0 billion, or 69%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a 70% increase in Total Orders to 1.4 billion, which led to a 70% increase in Marketplace GOV to $41.9 billion. The increase in Total Orders was primarily driven by increased engagement of existing consumers, the addition of new consumers, and an increase in the number of orders completed through Platform Services businesses.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased by $970 million, or 71%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in Total Orders and Marketplace GOV, as well as an increase in costs associated with our first-party distribution\nbusiness. Order management costs increased by $638 million and platform costs increased by $273 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $662 million, or 69%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $529 million in consumer, Dasher, and merchant advertising expenses and an increase of $87 million in personnel-related compensation expenses and allocated overhead due to increased headcount.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased by $109 million, or 34%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $225 million in personnel-related compensation expenses and allocated overhead due to increased headcount, partially offset by an increase in capitalized software and website development costs of $137 million.\nAs a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were 9% in the year ended December 31, 2021, decreasing from 11% in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue was driven by increased operating leverage as a result of increasing scale in our business.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $241 million, or 43%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $206 million in personnel-related compensation expenses and allocated overhead due to increased headcount.\nAs a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses were 16% in the year ended December 31, 2021, decreasing from 20% in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was driven by increased operating leverage as a result of increasing scale in our business.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased by $36 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $46 million in amortization expense related to capitalized software and website development costs and an increase of $16 million in depreciation expenses related to equipment for merchants, partially offset by a decrease of $38 million in amortization expenses related to intangible assets as the existing technology acquired from Caviar was fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased by 4 million, or 57%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in average interest rates earned on our investments during 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by 18 million, or 56%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the repayment of our Convertible Notes in February 2021.\nOther (expense) income, net\nOther income (expense), net was not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our business and financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of our business over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and\ndevelopment expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with their respective related GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and allocated overhead. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is non-cash in nature and we exclude allocated overhead as it is generally a fixed cost and is not directly impacted by Total Orders.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to adjusted cost of revenue:\nAdjusted Sales and Marketing Expense\nWe define adjusted sales and marketing expense as sales and marketing expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense and allocated overhead. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is non-cash in nature and we exclude allocated overhead as it is generally a fixed cost and is not directly impacted by Total Orders.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of sales and marketing expense to adjusted sales and marketing expense:\nAdjusted Research and Development Expense\nWe define adjusted research and development expense as research and development expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense and allocated overhead. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is non-cash in nature and we exclude allocated overhead as it is generally a fixed cost and is not directly impacted by Total Orders.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of research and development expense to adjusted research and development expense:\nAdjusted General and Administrative Expense\nWe define adjusted general and administrative expense as general and administrative expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, transaction-related costs, impairment expenses, and including allocated overhead from cost of revenue, sales and marketing, and research and development. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is non-cash in nature and we exclude certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, transaction-related costs, as well as impairment expenses, as these costs are not indicative of our operating performance.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of general and administrative expense to adjusted general and administrative expense:\n(1)We exclude certain costs and expenses from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense because management believes that these costs and expenses are not indicative of our core operating performance, do not reflect the underlying economics of our business, and are not necessary to operate our business. These excluded costs and expenses consist of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, (ii) reserves for the collection of sales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) costs related to the settlement of an intellectual property matter, (iv) expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification and price controls, and (v) donations as part of our COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management\u2019s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 and similar legislation.\n(2)Consists of impairment expense related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with our former headquarters.\nContribution Profit (Loss)\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders. We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. We define gross margin as gross profit (loss) as a percentage of revenue for the same period and we define Contribution Margin as Contribution Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue for the same period.\nGross profit (loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure to Contribution Profit (Loss). The following table provides a reconciliation of gross profit to Contribution Profit (Loss):\nAdjusted Gross Profit (Loss)\nWe define Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as gross profit (loss) plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue, and (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue. Gross profit (loss) is defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue. Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue for the same period.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of gross profit to Adjusted Gross Profit:\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) a one-time non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract related to the issuance of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, (iii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, (iv) transaction-related costs, (v) impairment expenses, (vi) provision for income taxes, (vii) interest income and expense, (viii) other income (expense), net, (ix) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (x) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the same period.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and a calculation of net margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin:\n(1)We exclude certain costs and expenses from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because management believes that these costs and expenses are not indicative of our core operating performance, do not reflect the underlying economics of our business, and are not necessary to operate our business. These excluded costs and expenses consist of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, (ii) reserves for the collection of sales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) costs related to the settlement of an intellectual property matter, (iv) expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification and price controls, and (v) donations as part of our COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management\u2019s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 and similar legislation.\n(2)Consists of impairment expense related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with our former headquarters.\n(3)In connection with the issuance of shares of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, we committed to sell an existing investor shares of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock in a subsequent closing at the initial issuance price of the Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock. We determined this commitment to be a forward contract, classified as a liability and measured at fair value on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. This forward contract was entered into and settled during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCredit Facilities\nOn November 19, 2019, we entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, provides for a $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on August 7, 2025, increasing to $400 million in aggregate revolving commitments upon the consummation of an IPO of our common stock on or prior to August 7, 2021. Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. We are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no amounts were drawn from the credit facility.\nWe maintain letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we had $66 million and $60 million of issued letters of credit outstanding, respectively, of which $44 million and $39 million were issued from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nConvertible Notes\nOn February 19, 2020, we issued $340 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes pursuant to the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement, dated February 19, 2020, among us, Caviar, and the investors party thereto, or the Note Investors. We received net proceeds of $333 million, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs and an original issue discount of $5 million. The interest rate under the Convertible Notes was 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. In February 2021, we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Convertible Notes in full for $375 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn December 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of shares of our Class A common stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $4.4 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion, and short-term marketable securities of $1.3 billion and long-term marketable securities of $650 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors of $320 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and consumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities. Marketable securities consisted of commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. Treasury securities.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may require additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\nOur material cash requirements relate to operating lease obligations for corporate office facility leases and purchase commitments for purchase of onboarding, technology platform infrastructure services and advertising services. For Information on contractual obligations for operating leases, see Note 8 - Leases included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information on non-cancellable purchase commitments as of December 31, 2021, see \"Non-cancelable Purchase Commitments\" section of Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification initiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $692 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This consisted of a net loss of $468 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $486 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $156 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $52 million, non-cash bad debt expense of $36 million, non-cash interest expense of $11 million related\nto the convertible notes, and other non-cash expenses of $28 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of an increase of $595 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, primarily related to Dasher and merchant payable, insurance reserves, accrued operations related expenses, contract liabilities, and accrued advertising, an decrease of $85 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and an increase of $79 million in accounts payable, offset by an increase of $174 million in funds held at payment processors, an increase of $94 in accounts receivable, net, a decrease of $44 million for payments for operating lease liabilities, an increase of $51 in other assets and an decrease of $5 million in other liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was mainly due to the decrease in net loss and increases in non-cash expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCash provided by operating activities was $252 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This consisted of a net loss of $461 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $322 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $120 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $40 million, non-cash interest expense of $31 million related to the convertible notes, non-cash bad debt expense of $16 million, and other non-cash expenses of $18 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of an increase of $587 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, primarily related to litigation reserves, sales tax payable and accrued sales and indirect taxes, accrued operations related expenses, Dasher and merchant payable, and contract liabilities, an increase of $54 million in accounts payable, and an increase of $11 million in other liabilities, offset by an increase of $248 million in accounts receivable, net, an increase of $96 million in funds held at payment processors, an increase of $96 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a decrease of $26 million for payments for operating lease liabilities, and an increase of $20 million in other assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $2,047 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $2,344 million, purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $409 million, purchases of property and equipment of $129 million, and cash outflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $108 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $944 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $192 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $593 million, purchases of property and equipment of $106 million, cash outflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $53 million, and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $28 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $587 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $483 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of $333 million of repayment of the convertible promissory notes, $172 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $10 million of payment of deferred offering costs, partially offset by $32 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities was $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of $3.3 billion of proceeds from issuance of common stock upon our IPO, net of underwriter discounts, $382 million of net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock, $333 million of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, and $5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by $7 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $6 million of payment of deferred offering costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606. We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplace and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with DoorDash. Revenue from our Marketplace is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant\u2019s products. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of our Marketplace. Revenue generated from DashPass memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. In addition, we also generate revenue from our Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant\u2019s products.\nOur local logistics platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore considered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner merchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery facilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have has determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in facilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplace. The consumer accesses the our local logistics platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants\u2019 products. These orders are picked up from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of our delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as an agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to prospective Dashers, we do not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of our transactions with end-users, we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and delivery services, thus we report revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We satisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant\u2019s products and we meet our performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nGift Cards\nWe sell gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through its Marketplace. Those gift cards have no expiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited history as to consumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded as contract liabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are redeemed, revenue is recognized on a net\nbasis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that we had developed sufficient historical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have the ability to estimate the portion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (\u201cbreakage\u201d) and for which there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. We recognize the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the pattern of revenue recognition for the gift card redemptions. As a result of this change in estimate, we recorded $48 million of gift card breakage revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Estimating future breakage rates requires judgment based on current and historical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage rates may vary from the estimate.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nWe offer various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay: We make additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities during peak demand time.\nDasher referrals: We offer referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once the new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. We expense the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, since the marketing of our platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to us. The portion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is accounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of our ultimate deductible obligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given our limited operational history, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward relevant industry claim and loss development factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions on a\nquarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations, and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade debt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not hedge these interest rate exposures.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies, primarily the Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported income and loss from our international businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss which is part of stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit).",

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of Insurance Reserves\nAs discussed in Note 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The retained insurance deductibles reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company\u2019s retained insurance deductibles reserves as of December 31, 2021 was $143 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's retained insurance deductibles reserves as a critical audit matter. The evaluation of the key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and expected loss rates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized skill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s retained insurance deductibles reserves process. This included controls over the development of the key assumptions related to loss development factors and expected loss rates. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in developing an independent range of the retained insurance deductibles reserves by selecting loss development factors and expected loss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 1, 2022\nDOORDASH, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nDOORDASH, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nDOORDASH, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nDOORDASH, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT)\n(in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands)\nDOORDASH, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT)\n(in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nDOORDASH, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nDOORDASH, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nDoorDash, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d), is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. The Company provides a local logistics platform that enables local businesses to address consumers\u2019 expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in today\u2019s convenience economy.\nThe Company\u2019s local logistics platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. The Company operates the DoorDash Marketplace, which enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting them with consumers (the \u201cMarketplace\u201d). Merchants can fulfill this demand with independent contractors who use the Company\u2019s platform to deliver orders (\u201cDashers\u201d). As part of the Marketplace, the Company also offers Pickup, which allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with no consumer fees, as well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on the Company\u2019s platform with large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. The Marketplace also includes DashPass, the Company\u2019s membership product, which was formerly referred to the Company's subscription product, which provides consumers with unlimited access to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and reduced service fees. In addition to the Marketplace, the Company offers Platform Services, which primarily includes DoorDash Drive (\"Drive\"), a white-label logistics service that enables merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using the Company\u2019s local logistics platform, and DoorDash Storefront (\"Storefront\") that enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in which it issued and sold 33 million shares of its Class A common stock at the public offering price of $102.00 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $3.3 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, all shares of the Company\u2019s outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 239 million shares of its common stock. Additionally, immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which authorizes a total of 6.0 billion shares of Class A common stock, 200 million shares of Class B common stock, 2.0 billion shares of Class C common stock, and 600 million shares of preferred stock. Upon the filing of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 285 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock were automatically reclassified into an equivalent number of shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock (the \u201cReclassification\u201d). Immediately after the Reclassification and prior to the completion of the IPO, a total of 31 million shares of Class A common stock held by Tony Xu, Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, and their respective affiliated trusts were exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As a result, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has three classes of authorized common stock: Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock, of which Class A common stock and Class B common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nThe Company granted certain employees restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) with both service-based and liquidity event-related performance vesting conditions (\"IPO Vested RSUs\"). Upon the consummation of the Company\u2019s IPO, the Company recognized $279 million of stock-based compensation expense for IPO Vested RSUs as the performance vesting condition was satisfied. One share of Class A common stock for each of the IPO Vested RSUs was settled and delivered on June 7, 2021 (the \u201cIPO Vested RSU Settlement Date\u201d). The future tax benefits on settlement of the above RSUs is not expected to be material as currently the Company has established valuation allowances to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nTo meet the related tax withholding requirements related to IPO Vested RSUs, for stockholders who elected to net share settle, the Company withheld 65,058 shares of Class A common stock subject to the vesting of the IPO Vested RSUs and paid $7 million to the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations as well as any income tax withholding obligations arising as a result of settlement of such shares. Certain employees elected to receive a short-term loan from the Company, with interest that accrued at the applicable federal rate. The short-term loan extended to employees totaled\n$10 million, which was repaid from the proceeds of the sale of shares into the market on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date.\nStock Splits\nIn November 2020, the Company\u2019s board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved a five-for-one forward stock split of the Company\u2019s common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock (collectively, the \u201cCapital Stock\u201d), which became effective on November 9, 2020. The authorized number of each class and series of Capital Stock was proportionally increased in accordance with the five-for-one stock split and the par value of each class of Capital Stock was not adjusted as a result of this forward stock split. All common stock, redeemable convertible preferred stock, stock options, RSUs, warrants, and per share information presented within these consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this forward stock split on a retroactive basis for all periods presented.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer is the Company\u2019s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates in one reportable segment. See Note 3 for revenue by geography. Long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, located outside of the United States were $15 million and $28 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for credit losses, gift card breakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and website development costs, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other financial instruments, valuation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting, insurance reserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions as well as cash in transit from payment processors. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and their carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Restricted cash consists of collateral provided for letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the restricted cash balances were not material and were included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities primarily consist of commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, and corporate bonds. The Company invests in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities and limits the concentration of its investment in any particular security. Securities with maturities greater than three months, but less than one year, are included in current assets and securities with maturities greater than one year are included in non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. All marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates the security for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If either of these criteria are met, the debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the Company evaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, as well as other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis. When a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, no allowance of credit losses related to marketable securities was recorded. Unrealized losses not resulting from credit losses are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nFunds Held at Payment Processors\nFunds held at payment processors represent cash due from the Company\u2019s payment processors for transactions with merchants and consumers, as well as funds transferred to payment processors for Dasher payout.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company\u2019s Drive offering. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a collective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each customer\u2019s expected ability to pay and collection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, the Company records a gain or loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed asset. Disposals were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described under \u201cImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company\u2019s impairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2021 and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. No impairment charge was recorded in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in and does not exercise significant influence over the investee are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment.\nThe carrying value is not adjusted for the Company\u2019s non-marketable equity securities if there are no observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment.\nIn 2021, the Company made investments in non-marketable equity securities of $409 million in cash for preferred shares of private companies including an investment of $395 million in cash for preferred shares of a grocery delivery platform company. All those investments were accounted for using the measurement alternative.\nThere are no adjustments or impairment associated with the Company\u2019s non-marketable equity securities during 2021. The Company does not have any realized or unrealized gains or losses on non-marketable equity securities as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nCapitalized Software and Website Development Costs\nThe Company incurred costs relating to the development of the Company\u2019s technology platform, which includes Dasher and merchant tools, mobile apps, and website and content development. Software development costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company\u2019s internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized during the application development stage of the project. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the post implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs to develop the Company\u2019s technology platform are capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional functionality are capitalized and expensed over the estimated useful life of the upgrades on a per project basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of the carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset or asset group over the asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s fair value generally determined by estimates of future discounted cash flows.\nAssets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company recognized impairment charges of $11 million and $1 million, respectively, related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with its former headquarters, which the Company subleased to another company.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company utilizes third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company\u2019s ultimate deductible obligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given our limited operational history, the Company utilizes assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward relevant industry claim and loss development factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from the Company\u2019s estimates, which could result in losses over the Company\u2019s reserved amounts. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company recorded additions to the insurance reserves of $12 million, $63 million and $134 million, respectively.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with its business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. The Company records a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes that a loss is not probable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjusts these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Sales and indirect tax liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. The financial statements of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currency, which is typically the local currency, into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at period end rates of exchange, and revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates. The resulting gain or loss is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. Prior to November 2020, RSUs granted by the Company vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition, which is typically four years, and a liquidity event-related performance vesting condition. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was achieved upon the consummation of the Company's IPO, and the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $279 million as of the IPO date for those RSUs for which the service-based vesting condition has been satisfied. Stock-based compensation related to the remaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied will be recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. Since November 2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award (as discussed further in Note 12), the Company only granted RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of\na service-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nFor the CEO Performance Award (as defined below) that includes a market condition, the fair value of the award was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The associated stock-based compensation is recorded over the derived service period, using the accelerated attribution method. If the stock price goals are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested award. Provided that Tony Xu continues to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, regardless of whether the stock price goals are achieved.\nPrior to the IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options and RSUs has historically been determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors as there is no public market for the underlying common stock. The Company\u2019s board of directors determined the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including: contemporaneous third-party valuations of its common stock, the valuation of comparable companies, sales of the Company\u2019s common and redeemable convertible preferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions (including the IPO), the Company\u2019s operating and financial performance, the lack of marketability, and the general and industry specific economic outlook, amongst other factors. After the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock is determined based on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") closing price on the date of grant.\nThe Company records forfeitures when they occur for all share-based payment awards.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by tax authorities. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.\nFair Value\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company\u2019s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds held at payment processors, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities. The Company has not experienced any significant credit losses historically.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment processors\u201d) including collecting amounts due from end-users and processing Dasher payouts. Payment processors are financial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit quality. The Company retains the risk of collecting such amounts from the payment processors, which are included in funds held at payment processors for the unsettled portion at each period end. The portion of the payments to be remitted to Dashers and merchants is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Although the Company pre-authorizes forms of payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company absorbs all credit card losses.\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company\u2019s Drive offering. As of December 31, 2020, three entities individually accounted for 20%, 14%, and 10% of accounts receivable, net, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, two entities individually accounted for 15% and 14% of accounts receivable, net, respectively. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 606, Revenue from Contracts with its Customers. The Company generates a substantial majority of its revenue from orders completed through the Marketplace and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with the Company. Revenue from the Marketplace is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant\u2019s products. The Company also generates revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of the Marketplace. Revenue generated from the Company\u2019s DashPass memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. In addition, the Company also generates revenue from its Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use its local logistics platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant\u2019s products.\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting for the fees collected in exchange for the use of the Company\u2019s local logistics platform, the Company considered its contractual arrangements with the parties involved as well as its customary business practices. Under the Company\u2019s agreements with partner merchants, the Company agrees to a commission to be earned as a percentage of the total dollar value of goods ordered. When a consumer signs up to use the Company\u2019s local logistics platform, the consumer agrees to be charged certain fees, at the time an order is placed, in exchange for use of the platform. The Company has concluded that a contract exists between the Company and a partner merchant when the partner merchant accepts each consumer\u2019s order, and a contract exists between the Company and a consumer when the consumer places the order and requests delivery services. The duration of a contract is typically equal to the time between when the order is placed and a Dasher picks up the food from the merchant. Contracts including variable consideration with partner merchants were not material for the periods presented.\nThe Company\u2019s local logistics platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the Company\u2019s platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. The Company has determined that the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and has therefore\nconsidered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner merchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery facilitation services, the Company evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether it controls each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, the Company has determined it is an agent for partner merchants in facilitating the sale of products to the consumer through the Marketplace. The consumer accesses the Company\u2019s local logistics platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants\u2019 products. These orders are picked up from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. The Company does not control the products prior to them being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of its delivery facilitation services, the Company has determined it is acting as an agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As the Company\u2019s role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to prospective Dashers, it does not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of its transactions with end-users, the Company is an agent in facilitating the sale of products and delivery services, thus the Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nDasher payout represents the amounts paid to Dashers for deliveries, including incentives and tips, except for certain referral bonuses. From time to time, Dashers may request an earlier payment settlement in exchange for a reduction in Dasher payout. The amounts payable to merchants and Dashers are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payments are typically settled on a weekly basis.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant\u2019s products and meets its performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nThe Company also provides value-add services to merchants. These services are generally considered separate performance obligations and revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. Revenue generated from such services is not material in all periods presented.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through the Marketplace. Those gift cards have no expiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited history as to consumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded as contract liabilities until consumers used the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are redeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that it had developed sufficient historical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have the ability to estimate the portion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (\u201cbreakage\u201d) and for which there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. The Company recognizes the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the pattern of revenue recognition for the gift card redemptions. As a result of this change in estimate, the Company recorded $48 million of gift card breakage revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Estimating future breakage rates requires judgment based on current and historical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage rates may vary from the estimate.\nRefunds and Credits\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may arise with orders. The Company accounts for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore records the amount of each refund or credit issued as a reduction of revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use its local logistics platform. Consumers typically receive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the incentives are described below:\nConsumer Promotions\nThe Company uses promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to its platform. Promotions offered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: The Company records discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nConsumer referrals: The Company offers referral credits to its existing consumers for referrals of new consumers. These referral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these credits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer acquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and marketing expenses in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess of the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, the Company offers promotional discounts to existing consumers. The Company records incentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nThe Company offers various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay: The Company makes additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities during peak demand time.\nDasher referrals: The Company offers referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once the new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. The Company expenses the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, since the marketing of the Company\u2019s platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to the Company. The portion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is accounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expenses were $446 million, $698 million and $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per common share following the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The Company considers its previously outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock to be participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between multiple classes of common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the period had been distributed. The holders of the Company\u2019s redeemable convertible preferred stock would be entitled to dividends in preference to common stockholders, at specified rates, if declared. Such dividends are not cumulative. Any remaining earnings would be\ndistributed among the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock pro rata on an as-converted basis. These holders of the Company\u2019s redeemable convertible preferred stock are not contractually obligated to participate in the Company\u2019s losses. As such, the Company\u2019s net losses were not allocated to these participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock are substantially identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock shared proportionately in the Company\u2019s net losses. No shares of Class C common stock were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Prior to the completion of the IPO, there were no shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding.\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive. Vested RSUs that have not been settled have been included in the appropriate common share class used to calculate basic net loss per share.\nUpon completion of the Company's IPO, all of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into 239 million shares of common stock and their carrying amount reclassified into stockholders' (deficit) equity. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, there were no shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nDeferred Offering Costs\nDeferred offering costs, which consist of direct incremental legal, consulting, accounting, and other fees relating to the anticipated sale of the Company\u2019s common stock in the IPO, were initially capitalized and recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. After the IPO, all deferred offering costs were reclassified into stockholders' (deficit) equity as a reduction of the IPO proceeds on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. ROU assets represents the Company's right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities represents the Company's obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease. The Company has elected the practical expedient not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with terms of twelve months or less. Expense related to short-term leases is recognized either straight-line over the lease term or as incurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company\u2019s classes of assets that are leased include real estate leases and equipment leases. Operating leases consist of real estate leases and are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases consist of equipment leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Most of the Company\u2019s leases are operating leases, and activities related to finance leases were not material for the periods presented.\nThe Company\u2019s real estate leases are for an initial period between one and 15 years, and typically include renewal options, the election of which is at the option of the Company. The Company includes renewal options in the measurement of lease liabilities only to the extent the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For leases that provide the option to terminate, the lease term includes periods covered by such options to the extent the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nThe Company subleases certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the subleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the subleases generally range from four to five years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no residual value guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes of performing lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because the Company does not typically borrow on a collateralized basis, it\nuses a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for collateralization, current available yield curves, and the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate incremental borrowing rate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\", which eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. For public business entities, this standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted 2019-12 on January 1, 2021. The cumulative effect upon adoption was not material to its consolidated financial statement.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of the update on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenue\nThe following tables present the Company\u2019s revenue disaggregated by offering and by geographical region.\nRevenue by offering was as follows (in millions):\nCore business is primarily comprised of Marketplace, which includes Pickup and DoorDash for Work, and Drive.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of DashPass, the address of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The Company\u2019s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from consumers and merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized over time. A summary of activities related to contract liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows (in millions):\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplace. When they are redeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to the reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net revenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is impracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $22 million associated with unearned prepayments received by the Company, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n(3) During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $48 million of gift card breakage revenue, which represented the estimate of cumulative gift card breakage through December 31, 2021 based on the Company's accounting policy discussed in Note 2.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company\u2019s contracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to recover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which the Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing expense and amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. A summary of activities related to deferred contract costs was as follows (in millions):\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable and changes were as follows (in millions):\n4. Acquisition\nIn December 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of a technology manufacturing company, which was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The total purchase consideration was approximately $30 million, of which $3 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, which primarily consisted of $22 million of intangible assets. The intangible assets acquired consisted entirely of existing technology, which has an estimated remaining useful life of 8 years as of the date of the acquisition. Additionally, the Company recorded $10 million of goodwill, which represented the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired.\nThis acquisition was not material to the Company for the periods presented and therefore, pro forma information has not been presented.\n5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the periods presented were as follows (in millions):\nThere was no goodwill impairment during the periods presented. See Note 4 for further details of goodwill recorded.\nIntangible assets, net consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\nIn October 2019, the Company acquired Caviar in an effort to help grow its business, advance its strategy of offering consumers differentiated merchant selection, and enable the Company to cater to even more food preferences and occasions. As a result of the Company\u2019s progress of integrating Caviar into its existing technology platform, the Company evaluated the remaining useful life of existing technology in February 2020 and determined there was a change in the estimated useful life of this asset that would require an acceleration of the amortization expense. The useful life of Caviar existing technology was reduced to 0.7 years at the time of the change in estimate, resulting in additional amortization expense of $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIntangible assets, net consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):\nAmortization expense associated with intangible assets was $7 million, $51 million, and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nThe estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets as of December 31, 2021 was as follows (in millions):\n6. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables set forth the Company\u2019s financial instruments that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy (in millions):\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s Level 1 financial instruments is based on quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets. The fair value of the Company\u2019s Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments in less active markets or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data.\nThere were no Level 3 assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n7. Balance Sheet Components\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables summarize the cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gain, gross unrealized loss, and fair value of the Company\u2019s cash equivalents and marketable securities (in millions):\nNo individual security incurred continuous unrealized losses for greater than twelve months as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in millions):\nDepreciation expenses were $20 million, $52 million, and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company capitalized $15 million, $61 million, and $202 million in capitalized software and website development costs during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. Capitalized software and website development costs are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of capitalized software and website development costs was $5 million, $17 million, and $63 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. Construction in progress primarily included leasehold improvements on premises that are not ready for use and equipment for merchants that are not placed in service.\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):\n8. Leases\nThe Company leases its facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire between 2022 and 2035. Certain of these arrangements have free rent, escalating rent payment provisions, lease renewal options, and tenant allowances. Under such arrangements, the Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term. Lease costs, net of sublease income, was $29 million, $46 million, and $66 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.\nIn June 2019, the Company subleased its previous headquarters office space to another company (the \u201cSublessee\u201d). The sublease required Sublessee to pay 100% of any rent and other related expenses due and payable under the existing lease with the landlord (the \u201cHead Lease\u201d), however the Company was not relieved from its legal obligation to the landlord under the Head Lease. Accordingly, an operating lease liability and an operating lease ROU asset was reflected on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets related to the Head Lease. Prior to April 2020, all payments due and payable by Sublessee were made timely.\nIn early April 2020, as a result of a disruption to Sublessee\u2019s business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sublessee informed the Company that it would not be making any future monthly rent payments. Accordingly, the Company ceased recognizing sublease income beginning in April 2020, and further determined that an impairment existed and recognized an impairment charge of $11 million and $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, reducing the carrying value of the ROU asset to its estimated fair value. Fair value of the ROU asset was estimated using an income-approach based on forecasted future cash flows expected to be derived from the property based on current sublease market rent.\nThe components of lease costs related to the Company\u2019s operating leases included in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented were as follows (in millions):\nLease terms and discount rates for operating leases were as follows:\nSupplemental cash flow and non-cash information was as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had entered into long term non-cancelable real estate lease contracts of $120 million and $19 million, respectively, for which leases have not yet commenced. Such leases are not included in the operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the future minimum lease payments required under operating leases were as follows (in millions):\nFuture minimum sublease income as of December 31, 2021 is $7 million.\n9. Promissory Notes\nIn February 2020, the Company issued convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $340 million with an initial maturity date in March 2025 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d). The Company received net proceeds of $333 million, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs, reflecting an original issue discount on the principal of $5 million. The interest rate is 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.\nIn February 2021, the Company repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the 2020 Notes in full for $375 million.\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or not a potential loss amount or a\npotential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring recognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential disclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has been and continues to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court (\u201cDynamex\u201d). The California Legislature passed legislation (\u201cAB 5\u201d), that was signed into law in September 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application and created numerous carve-outs, which may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may lead to increased legal proceedings and related expenses and may require the Company to significantly alter its existing business model and operations. Further, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to determine worker classification.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company\u2019s business practices, the classification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, and other matters. For example, the company is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of California for payroll tax liabilities. The Company believes that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors, and thus plans to vigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits is uncertain.\nIn October 2019, the Company made an offer, and in November 2019 it filed a settlement agreement, of $40 million with the representatives of Dashers that had filed actions in the States of California and Massachusetts in order to settle claims under the Private Attorney General Act and class action claims alleging worker misclassification of Dashers against the Company. These actions were filed by and on behalf of Massachusetts Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since August 2016. On June 8, 2020, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be paid by the Company from $40 million to $41 million. In October 2020, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be paid by the Company from $41 million to $89 million. In April 2021, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement increasing the total amount to be paid by the Company to $100 million. In January 2022, the settlement received final approval and the company anticipates the payout of $100 million in 2022.\nIn March 2020, the Company reached an agreement to resolve worker misclassification claims associated with certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the Company. Under the agreement, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers were eligible for settlement payments, subject to a threshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements. In July 2020, the Company transferred $69 million into an escrow account to be paid to claimants and claimants\u2019 attorneys if a minimum number of claimants agreed to release their claims against the Company by the date specified within the settlement agreement. In December 2020, the number of claimants who agreed to release their claims against the Company exceeded the minimum, and the Company was committed to release the settlement amount in the escrow account to claimants and claimants' attorneys. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the $69 million in the escrow account was fully distributed to the claimants and claimants' attorneys.\nIn July and August 2020, the Company reached additional agreements to resolve worker misclassification claims associated with certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the Company. Under these agreements, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers were eligible for settlement payments, subject to a threshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements. The aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers under these individual settlement agreements, including attorneys\u2019 fees, was $14 million, which was fully paid in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the Company from continuing to classify Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been made. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements.\nThe Company has entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the individual.\nNo liability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nNon-cancelable Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments, which primarily relate to the purchase of onboarding, data processing, technology platform infrastructure, and advertising services. These purchase commitments are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 as the Company has not yet received the related services. As of December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments under the Company\u2019s non-cancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in millions):\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provides for a $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at the Company\u2019s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and restrictions on the use of proceeds, as well as customary negative covenants that restrict its ability and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, declare cash dividends in the entirety or make certain other distributions, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of its assets, make investments, loans and acquisitions, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\nIn August 2020, the Company amended and restated its existing revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide for $100 million of incremental revolving loan commitments, effective upon consummation of an IPO of the Company\u2019s common stock on or prior to August 7, 2021, for total revolving commitments of $400 million. The amendment and restatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit facility from November 19, 2024 to August 7, 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, no amounts were drawn from the credit facility.\nThe Company maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had $66 million and $60 million of issued letters of credit outstanding, respectively, of which $44 million and $39 million were issued from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company is under audit by various state and local tax authorities with regard to sales and indirect tax matters. The Company records sales and indirect tax reserves when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if\nany, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the Company will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments could result in changes to the Company's reserves related to positions on sales and indirect tax filings. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company favorably resolved a sales and indirect tax exposure resulting in a $29 million reduction of liabilities previously reserved.\n11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn June 2020, the Company entered into a Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock purchase agreement pursuant to which it issued a total of 8,321,395 shares of Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock at $45.9062 per share for gross proceeds of $382 million. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material.\nThe Company previously issued Series A-1, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, Series F, and Series G prior to 2020. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO on December 9, 2020, all outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into an aggregate of 239,269,631 shares of Class A common stock.\nThe following table summarizes the redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the conversion into common stock, and the rights and preferences of the Company\u2019s respective series preceding the Company\u2019s IPO in December 2020 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\n(1) The issuance price for Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock was $5.50688, except for shares issued via the conversion of certain of the outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in 2017, for which the conversion price was $4.78778 per share.\nForward Contract In Connection with Issuance of Series F Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn February 2019, the Company issued a total of 13,736,615 shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock at $22.4751 per share for gross proceeds of $309 million. To accommodate the timing of regulatory approvals required by an existing investor (who did not participate in the initial issuance of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock), the Company committed to sell 4,449,370 shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock at $22.4751 per share for gross proceeds of $100 million to this investor in a subsequent closing, which ultimately occurred in May 2019. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material. At the date of the initial closing, the Company determined that the commitment to defer the sale of shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock to this investor represented a freestanding instrument that should be classified as a liability and measured at fair value on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The initial measurement of the liability at its fair value of $1 million was recorded with a corresponding reduction recognized in additional paid-in capital as a deemed dividend distributed to the investor. Immediately prior to the subsequent closing in May 2019, the fair value of the liability was determined to be $68 million, resulting in an expense of $67 million recorded to other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations which was attributable to the increase in the fair value of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock. Upon the subsequent closing, the carrying amount of the liability was reclassified to mezzanine equity.\nThe fair value of the liability (valued as a forward contract) at issuance and as of subsequent closing was determined with the following assumptions:\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, there was no preferred stock issued and outstanding.\n12. Common Stock\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on an as-converted basis (in thousands):\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended (\"2014 Plan\"), which provided for the granting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014 Plan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted for a term of up to ten years (or five years if the option was an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted generally vest over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon early exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to repurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees\u2019 employment terminated for any reason. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same rate as the original option vesting schedule. Stock-based awards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of shares of common stock available for issuance.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2014 Plan was terminated effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased granting any additional awards under the 2014 Plan. All outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to the terms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or repurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically transferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan, which became effective one business day prior to the effective date of the IPO Registration Statement. The 2020 Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation\nrights, performance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the Company's employees, directors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are forfeited, canceled, or repurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on January 1, 2021 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 32,493,000 shares, (ii) five percent (5%) of the total number of all classes of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each automatic increase, or (iii) such other number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to the applicable January 1.\nThe exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten years (or five years if the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest over four years.\nRSUs\nPrior to November 2020, the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of both service-based and liquidity event-related performance vesting conditions. The service-based vesting condition for these awards generally is satisfied over four years. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was achieved upon the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s IPO, resulting in the Company recording cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $279 million for IPO Vested RSUs. Stock-based compensation related to the remaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied will be recorded over the remaining requisite service period. Since November 2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award discussed below, the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition which is generally four years.\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, the Company\u2019s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000 RSUs to the CEO (the \u201cCEO Performance Award\u201d). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and achievement of certain stock price goals. The CEO Performance Award is excluded from Class A common stock issued and outstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The CEO Performance Award also provides the holder with certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common stock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. However, the CEO Performance Award is not considered a participating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the right to the cumulative declared dividends is forfeitable if the service condition is not met.\nThe CEO Performance Award is eligible to vest beginning on the first trading day 18 months following the day Company\u2019s IPO date, and expiring seven years after the IPO date. The CEO Performance Award comprises nine tranches that are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, ranging from $187.60 to $501.00 per share, each of which are referred to as a Company Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 180-day trading period during the performance period as set forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward the CEO only if the Company achieved sustained growth in the stock price.\nThe Company calculated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award based on multiple stock price paths developed through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation model also calculates a derived service period for each of the nine vesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve each Company Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo simulation model requires the use of various assumptions, including the underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to the length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award was $39.8275 per share. The Company will recognize total stock-based compensation expense of $413 million over the derived service period of each tranche, which is between 2.53 to 4.42 years, using the accelerated attribution method as long as the CEO satisfies the service-based vesting condition. If the Company Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will adjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. Provided that Tony Xu continues to be the Company's CEO, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, regardless of whether the Company Stock Price Targets are achieved.\nThe Company recorded $12 million and $112 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award was $289 million.\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of activity under the 2014 and 2020 Plans and related information was as follows (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of the stock option and the estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock as of the respective period-end dates. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $47 million, $129 million, and $2.3 billion, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $11.78 per share. There were no stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nThe summary of RSU activity was as follows (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the closing price on the NYSE as of the respective period-end dates. The weighted-average fair value per share of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $27.31, $56.27, and $170.42, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted for the periods presented were as follows:\nThere were no stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was $7 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.64 years.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was $1.6 billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, excluding the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the CEO Performance Award. The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining weighted-average period of 2.61 years.\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"the ESPP\"), which became effective on the business day immediately prior to the effectiveness of the IPO. A total of 6,498,600 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for sale under the ESPP. The number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the first enrollment date (if any) occurs equal to the least of (i) 6,498,600 shares of Class A common stock, (ii) one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the outstanding shares of all classes of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the ESPP.\nThe ESPP includes two components: a component that allows the Company to make offerings intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code and a component that allows the Company to make offerings not intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code to designated companies. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute (in the form of payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the administrator) an amount established by the administrator from time to time in its discretion to purchase Class A common stock at a discounted price per share.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, there had been no offering period or purchase period under the ESPP, and no such period will begin unless and until determined by the administrator.\n13. Income Taxes\nU.S. and foreign components of consolidated loss before income taxes was as follows (in millions):\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $1 million, $3 million, and $5 million, respectively. The provision for income taxes primarily consisted of franchise tax and U.S. federal and state income tax, as well as international taxes from foreign operations.\nThe reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company\u2019s effective tax rate was as follows:\nNo deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded relating to the earnings of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested.\nThe significant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):\nThe Company accounts for deferred taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the ASC 740 more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. This assessment considers matters such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets requires that the Company weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Due to the lack of U.S. earnings history, the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. Overall, the valuation allowance increased by $154 million, $97 million and $1,041 million in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had accumulated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $4,125 million and $3,265 million, respectively. Of the $4,125 million of federal net operating losses, $4,042 million is carried forward indefinitely but is limited to 80% of taxable income. The remaining federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036 and 2024, respectively.\nThe Company also had $209 million of federal and $114 million of California research and development tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2021. The federal research and development tax credits expire in varying amounts starting in 2033. The California research credits do not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be limited in the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state tax law. Based on the most recent analysis, the Company does not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $7 million and $69 million, respectively, of tax benefits, that, if recognized, majority would result in adjustments to the valuation allowance. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax positions existing at December 31, 2021 will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is included in the table below (in millions):\nThe Company\u2019s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within provision for income taxes, which were immaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as foreign jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s income tax returns generally remain subject to examination by United States federal and state and foreign tax authorities.\n14. Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in the Company\u2019s net losses. Before the IPO, the Company\u2019s outstanding securities also included convertible preferred stock. The holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock did not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company\u2019s losses, and as a result, net losses were not allocated to these securities.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders during the periods presented. The shares issued in the IPO and the shares of Class A common stock issued upon conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock in the IPO, as well as vested RSUs that have not been settled are included in the table below weighted for the period outstanding in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect (in thousands):\n(1) The CEO Performance Award is excluded from the above table because the Company Stock Price Target had not been met as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n15. 401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible and participating employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company does not make contributions for eligible employees.\n16. Subsequent Events\nOn February 14, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an ordering and payment platform company domiciled in the United States for approximately $90 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer (\u201ccertifying officers\u201d), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our certifying officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2021.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management, under the oversight of our Board of Directors, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. That Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nOur management, including our certifying officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to the inherent limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
